<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>IN DEFIANCE OF DUTY</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow being Saturday afternoon,&#8221;
began Eveley, deftly slipping a
dish of sweet pickles beyond the reach of the
covetous fat fingers of little niece Nathalie,&mdash;&#8220;to-morrow
being Saturday afternoon&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t to-morrow start at sunrise as
usual?&#8221; queried her brother-in-law curiously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As every laborer knows,&#8221; said Eveley
firmly, &#8220;Saturday begins with the afternoon
off. And I am a laborer. Therefore, to-morrow
being Saturday-afternoon-off, and since
I have trespassed on your hospitality for a
period of two months, it behooves me to find
me a home and settle down.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Eveley,&#8221; protested her sister in a soft
troubled voice, &#8220;don&#8217;t be disagreeable. You
talk as if we were strangers. Aren&#8217;t we the
only folks you have? And aren&#8217;t you my own
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
and only baby sister? If you can&#8217;t live with
us, where can you live?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;As it says in the Bible,&#8221; explained Eveley,
truthfully if unscripturally, &#8220;no two families
are small enough for one house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But who calls you a family?&#8221; interrupted
the brother-in-law.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. And nice and sweet as you all are,
and adorable as I am well aware am I, all of
you and all of me can not be confined to one
house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we have counted on it,&#8221; persisted
Winifred earnestly. &#8220;We have looked forward
to it. We have always said that you
would come to us when Aunt Eloise died,&mdash;and
she did&mdash;and you must. We&mdash;we expect
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;England expects every man to do his
duty,&#8217;&#8221; quoted Burton in a sepulchral voice.
</p>
<p>Then Eveley rose in her place, tall and
formidable. &#8220;That is it,&mdash;duty. Then let me
announce right now, once and for all, Burton
Raines and Winifred, eternally and everlastingly,
I do not believe in duty. No one shall
do his duty by me. I publicly protest against
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
it. I won&#8217;t have it. I have had my sneaking
suspicions of duty for a long time, and lately
I have been utterly convinced of the folly and
the sin of it. Whenever any one has anything
hateful or disagreeable to do, he draws a long
voice and says it is his duty. It seems that
every mean thing in the world is somebody&#8217;s
duty. Duty has been the curse of civilization
for lo, these many years!&#8221; Then she sat
down. &#8220;Please pass the jam.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, all right, all right,&#8221; said Burton
amiably, &#8220;have it your own way, by all
means. Henceforth and forever after, we positively
decline to do our duty by you. But
what is our duty to you? Answer me that,
and then I guarantee not to do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is our duty to keep Eveley right here
with us and take care of her,&#8221; said Winifred,
with as much firmness as her soft voice
could master. &#8220;She is ours, and we are hers,
and it is our duty to stand between her and
a hard world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t. In the first place I am awfully
stuck on the world, and want to get real
chummy with it. Any one who tries to stand
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
between it and me, shall be fired out bodily,
head first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Eveley,&#8221; came a sudden wail from
Winifred, &#8220;you can&#8217;t go off and live by yourself.
What will people think? They will say
we could not get along together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is it,&mdash;just that and nothing more.
It isn&#8217;t duty that bothers you&mdash;it is What-will-people-think?
An exploded theory, nothing
more.&#8221; Then she smiled at her sister
winsomely. &#8220;You positively are the sweetest
thing, Winnie. And your Burton I absolutely
love. And your babies are the most irresistible
angels that ever came to bless and&mdash;enliven&mdash;a
sordid world. But you are a family
by yourselves. You are used to doing what
you want, and when you want, and how you
want. I would be an awful nuisance. When
Burton would incline to a quiet evening, I
should have a party. When you and he would
like to slip off to a movie, you would have to
be polite and invite me. Nobody could be
crazier about nieces and nephews than I am,
but sometimes if I were tired from my work
their chatter might make me peevish. And
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
you would punish them when I thought you
shouldn&#8217;t, and wouldn&#8217;t do it when I thought
you should, and think of the arguments
there would be. And so we all agree, don&#8217;t
we, that it would be more fun for me to move
off by myself and then come to see you and
be company,&mdash;rather than stick around under
your feet until you grow deadly tired of me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not agree,&#8221; said Winifred.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Burton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then we are a majority, and it is all
settled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But where in the world will you live,
dear? You could not stand a boarding-house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I could if I had to, but I don&#8217;t have to. I
have been favored with an inspiration. I can&#8217;t
imagine how it ever happened, but perhaps
it was a special dispensation to save you from
me. I am going to live in my own house on
Thorn Street. Of course it will be lonely
there at first, since Aunt Eloise is gone&mdash;but
just listen to this. I shall rent the down-stairs
part to a small family and I shall live
up-stairs. Part of the furniture I am going
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
to sell, use what I want to furnish my dove
cote in the clouds, and the rest that is too
nice to sell but can&#8217;t be used I shall store in
the east bedroom, which I won&#8217;t use. That
will leave me three rooms and a bath&mdash;bedroom,
sitting-room and dining-room. I can
fix up a corner of the dining-room into a kitchen
with my electric percolator and grills
and things. Isn&#8217;t it a glorious idea? And
aren&#8217;t you surprised that I thought of anything
so clever by myself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not half bad,&#8221; said Burton approvingly,&mdash;for
Burton had long since learned that the
pleasantest way of keeping friends with in-laws
is by perpetual approval.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can never find a small family to
take the down-stairs part of the house,&#8221;
came pessimistically from Winifred.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, but I have found it, and they are in
the house already. A bride and groom. The
cunningest things! She calls him Dody, and
they hold hands. And I sold part of the furniture
yesterday, and had the rest moved up-stairs.
But there is one thing more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought so,&#8221; said Burton grimly. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
remember the Saturday-afternoon-off. I
thought perhaps you had me in mind for your
furniture-heaver. But since that is done it is
evident you have something far more deadly
in store for me. Let me know the worst,
quickly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you know, dearie,&#8221; said Eveley in
most seductively sweet tones, &#8220;you know how
the house is built. There is only one stairway,
and it rises directly from the west room
down-stairs. Unfortunately, my bride and
groom wish to use that room for a bedroom.
Now you can readily perceive that a young
and unattached female could not in conscience&mdash;not
even in my conscience&mdash;utilize a stairway
emanating from the boudoir of a bridal
party. And there you are!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am no carpenter,&#8221; Burton shouted quickly,
when Eveley&#8217;s voice drifted away into an
apologetic murmur. &#8220;Get that idea out of
your head right away. I don&#8217;t know a nail
from a hammer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, Burtie, of course you don&#8217;t,&#8221; she said
soothingly. &#8220;But this will be very simple.
I thought of a rambling, rustic stairway outside
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
the house, in the back yard. You know
the sun parlor was an afterthought, only one
story high with a flat roof. So the rustic
stairway could go up to the roof of the sun
parlor, and I could make that up into a sort
of roof garden. Wouldn&#8217;t it be picturesque
and pretty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is no door from your room to
the roof of the sun parlor,&#8221; objected Burton.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, but the window is very wide. I will
just cover it with portières and things, and I
am quite active so I can get in and out very
nicely. And when I get around to it, and have
the money, I may have a French window
put in.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Eveley, I can&#8217;t build a stairway. I
don&#8217;t know how to build anything. I couldn&#8217;t
build a box.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you do not have to do this alone,
Burtie. Just the foundation, that is all I expect
of you. You will have lots of assistance.
Not experienced help perhaps, but enthusiastic,
and &#8216;love goes in with every nail,&#8217;&mdash;that
sort of thing. I have sent invitations
to all of my friends of the masculine persuasion,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span>
and we have started a competition.
Each admirer is to build two steps according
to his own design and plan, and the
one who builds most artistically is to receive,
not my hand and heart, but a lovely dinner
cooked on my grill in my private dining-room.
I have the list here. I figured that twelve
steps will be enough. Nolan Inglish, two.
Lieutenant Ames, two. Captain Hardin, two.
Jimmy Weaver, two. Dick Fairwether, two.
Arnold Bender, two. Arnold is Kitty&#8217;s beau,
but she guaranteed two steps for him. Won&#8217;t
it be lovely?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow being Saturday afternoon,&#8221;
said Burton bitterly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I ordered the rustic lumber last night, and
it was delivered to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you consider it my duty as the luckless
husband of your long-suffering sister, to
lay the foundation for the wabbly, rattly
ramshackle stairs your pet assortment of
moonstruck admirers will build for you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not your duty, Burtie, certainly not your
duty. But your pleasure and your great joy.
For without the stairway, I can not live there.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
And if I do not live there, I must live here.
And remember. When you want vaudeville,
I will incline to grand opera. When you
would enjoy a movie, I shall have a musicale
here at home. When you are in the midst of
a novel, I shall insist on a three-handed game
of bridge. When you are ready to shave, I
shall need the hot water. When your appetite
calls for corned beef and cabbage, my
soul shall require lettuce sandwiches and
iced tea. Not your duty, dear, by any means.
I do not believe in duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quite right, sweet sister,&#8221; he said pleasantly.
&#8220;It shall afford me infinite pleasure, I
assure you. And to-morrow being Saturday
afternoon, you shall have your stairway.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>THE COTE IN THE CLOUDS</h3>
</div>

<p>As Eveley had prophesied, what her
carpenters lacked in experience and
skill was more than compensated by their
ambition and their eagerness to please. On
Saturday afternoon her back yard was a
veritable bee-hive of industry. The foundation
was in readiness for the handiwork of
love, for Burton Raines, feeling that he
could not concentrate on business in such
sentimental environs, explained patiently that
he was only an ordinary married man and
that love rhapsodies to the tune of temperamental
hammering upset him. So he had
taken the morning off from his own business,
to lay the foundation for the rustic stairway.
</p>
<p>Nolan Inglish, listed first because he was
always listed first with Eveley, appeared at
eleven o&#8217;clock, having explained to the lofty
members of the law firm of which he was a
junior assistant, that serious family matters
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
required his attention. This enabled him to
have the two bottom-most steps of the stairway,
comprising his portion, erected and
ready for inspection by the time Eveley arrived
home from her work. He said he had
felt it would be lonely for her to sit around
by herself while everybody else worked for
her, and having provided against that exigency
by doing his labor in advance, he
claimed the privilege of officiating as entertainer-in-chief
for the entire afternoon.
</p>
<p>Arnold Bender appeared next, accompanied
by Kitty Lampton, one of Eveley&#8217;s pet and
particular friends. Although Kitty was extremely
generous in proffering the services
of her friend in behalf of Eveley&#8217;s stairway,
she frankly stated that she was not willing
to expose any innocent young man of her
possession to the wiles and smiles of her attractive
friend, without herself on hand to
counteract any untoward influence.
</p>
<p>Captain Hardin and Lieutenant Ames came
together with striking military éclat, accompanied,
as became their rank, by two alert
enlisted men. After introducing their enlisted
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_23' name='page_23'></a>23</span>
men in the curt official manner of the
army and having set them grandly to work
on the rustic stairway, Captain Hardin and
Lieutenant Ames immediately took up a
social position in the tiny rose-bowered pergola,
with Eveley and Kitty and Nolan and
the lemonade.
</p>
<p>A little later, Jimmy Weaver rattled up in
his small striped gaudy car, followed presently
by Dick Fairwether on a noisy motorcycle.
They took out their personal sets of
tools from private recesses of their machines
and plunged eagerly into the contest.
</p>
<p>So the afternoon started most auspiciously
and all would doubtless have gone well and
peacefully, had not Captain Hardin most unfortunately
selected an exceptionally good-looking
young soldier for his service,&mdash;a tall,
slender, dark-skinned youth, with merry
melting eyes. Eveley never attempted to
deny that she could not resist merry melting
eyes. So she left the young officers and Kitty
and Nolan and the lemonade in the rose-bowered
pergola on the edge of the canyon
which sloped down abruptly on the east side,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
and herself went up to superintend the building
of her stairway.
</p>
<p>The handsome one required an inordinate
amount of superintending. The other soldier
detailed by Lieutenant Ames, an ordinary
young man with a sensible face and eyes that
saw only hammer and nails, got along very
well by himself. But the handsome youth,
called Buddy Gillian, required supervision on
every point. He first consulted Eveley about
the design of the two steps entrusted to him
for construction. He could think of as many
as two dozen different styles of rustic steps,
and he explained and illustrated them all to
Eveley in great detail, drawing plans in the
gravel path. It took the two of them nearly
an hour to make a selection, and then it
seemed the style they had chosen was the
most difficult of the entire assortment, and
was practically impossible for any one to
construct alone. So Eveley perforce assisted,
holding the rustic boughs while he
hammered, carrying the saw, and carefully
picking out the proper size of nails as he
required them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you have more sense than to bring
a good-looker?&#8221; Nolan asked Captain Hardin
in a fretful voice. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you know that
Eveley can&#8217;t resist good looks?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told him he had no business to bring
Gillian,&#8221; put in the lieutenant. &#8220;Look at
Muggs, whom I brought. Nobody notices that
Muggs needs any help. See there now, he
has finished and is ready to go. Can&#8217;t you do
something to stop this, Miss Lampton?&#8221; he
pleaded, turning to Kitty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as she leaves my Arnold alone,
I shall mind my own business,&#8221; said Kitty
decidedly. &#8220;If I cut in on her affair with
your Buddy, she will try her hand on Arnold
to get even. Captain Hardin got you into
this, it is up to him to get you out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Kitty heartlessly left the pergola and
went up to the rustic steps to hold the hammer
for Arnold.
</p>
<p>Then Captain Hardin, after rapidly drinking
three glasses of iced lemonade to drown
his chagrin and to strengthen his flagging
courage, left the cozy pergola which had no
attraction for any of them with Eveley out
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
at work on the rustic stairway, and went up
to the corner where she and Buddy Gillian
were carefully and conscientiously matching
bits of rustic lumber.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think I should keep you any
longer, Gillian, since Muggs is ready to go,&#8221;
he said kindly. &#8220;I can finish this myself now,
thank you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said Buddy Gillian courteously,
and stood up. Then to Eveley, &#8220;Shall I gather
up the scraps, Miss Ainsworth, and tidy the
lawn for you? It is pretty badly littered.
Only too glad to be of service, if I may.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, thank you, Mr. Gillian, that is sweet
of you,&#8221; said Eveley gratefully. &#8220;Suppose we
begin down in that corner by the rose pergola,
and gather up the scraps as we come
this way. I&#8217;ll carry this basket, and you can
do the picking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But even this humble field of usefulness
was denied Private Gillian, for Lieutenant
Ames came out from the pergola and said
with official briskness, &#8220;Oh, never mind that,
Gillian. I can help Miss Ainsworth with it.
You&#8217;d better run along with Muggs and enjoy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
your liberty period. Much obliged to you,
I am sure.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the handsome Buddy looked deep into
Eveley&#8217;s eyes, and sighed. Eveley held out
her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have done just beautifully,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;and helped me so much. And when are
you coming to tell me the rest of that thrilling
story of your life in the trenches?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The question is, when may I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Tuesday evening? Or can you get
off on Tuesday?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, since the war is over we can get
off any night. Tuesday will suit me fine.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sorry, Gillian,&#8221; put in Captain Hardin
grimly. &#8220;But unfortunately I have arranged
for a company school on Tuesday night&mdash;to
be conducted by Lieutenant Carston.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Gillian turned his beautiful eyes on Eveley,
eyes no longer merry but sad and wistful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me see,&#8221; puzzled Eveley promptly.
&#8220;Could you come to-morrow night then, Mr.
Gillian? Captain won&#8217;t mind changing with
you, I know, and he can come on Tuesday.
Captains can always get away, can&#8217;t they? Is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
that all right?&mdash;Then to-morrow evening,
about eight. And I will have a little evening
supper all ready for you. Good-by.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After he had gone she said to the captain
apologetically, &#8220;Hasn&#8217;t he wonderful eyes?
And I knew he must be quite all right for me
to know, or you would never have introduced
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Taken all in all, only Kitty Lampton and
Eveley considered the raising of the rustic
stairway an entire success, although there
was much light talk and laughter as they ate
the dainty supper the girls had prepared for
them in the Cloud Cote, as Eveley had already
christened her home above the earth.
But the men, with the exception of Nolan,
were doomed to disappointment.
</p>
<p>When Dick Fairwether asked her to go to
a movie with him in the evening, and when
Jimmy Weaver invited her to go for a night
drive with him along the beach, and when
Captain Hardin suggested that she accompany
him to the Columbine dance at the San
Diego, and when Lieutenant Ames wanted to
make a foursome with Kitty and Arnold to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
go boating, she said most regretfully to each,&mdash;&#8220;Isn&#8217;t
it a shame? But my sister is having
some kind of a silly club there to-night, and
I promised to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But to Nolan, very secretly she whispered:
&#8220;Now you trot along to the office and work
and when I am ready to come home I will
phone you to come and get me. And we will
initiate the Cloud Cote all by ourselves.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the little party broke up almost immediately
after supper, with deep avowals
of gratitude on the part of Eveley, and
equally deep assurances of pleasure and good
will on the part of the others. After they had
gone, as Eveley inspected her stairway alone,
she was comforted by the thought that she
could fairly smother it with vines and all
sorts of creeping and climbing things, and
the casual comer would not notice how funny
and wabbly it was. But as she went gingerly
down, clinging desperately to the rail on both
sides, she determined to take out an accident
policy immediately, with a special clause
governing rustic stairways.

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>EVERYBODY&#8217;S DUTY</h3>
</div>

<p>Due to the old-fashioned, rambling style
of the house, the rustic stairway did
not really detract from its beauty. And as
there were already clambering vines and
roses in profusion, an extra arbor more or
less, could, as Eveley claimed, pass without
serious comment. Although the house was
old, it was still exquisitely beautiful, with its
cream white pillars and columns showing behind
the mass of green. And the lawn, which
was no lawn but only a natural park running
riot with foliage coaxed into endless lovers&#8217;
nooks and corners, was a fitting and marvelously
beautiful setting for it.
</p>
<p>The gardens were in the shape of a triangle,
with conventional paved streets on the
north and west, but on the east and south
they drifted away into the shadowy canyon
which stretched down almost to the bay, and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span>
came out on the lower streets of the water-front.
</p>
<p>Eveley stood on her rustic stairway and
gloated over it lovingly,&mdash;the rambling house,
the rambling gardens, the beautiful rambling
canyon, and then on below to the lights on
the bay, clustered together in companionable
groups.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Loma Portal, Fort Rosecranz, North Island,
Coronado, and the boats in the bay,&#8221;
she whispered softly, pointing slowly to the
separate groups. And her eyes were very
warm, for she loved each separate light in
every cluster, and she was happy that she
was at home again, in the place that had
been home to her since the days of her early
memory.
</p>
<p>Eveley&#8217;s mother had been born in the house
on Thorn Street, as had her sister, Eloise,
the aunt with whom the girls had lived for
many years. And after the death of her husband,
when Eveley was a tiny baby, Emily
Ainsworth had taken her two girls and gone
back to live with her sister in the family
home. There a few years later she too had
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span>
passed away, leaving her children in the tender,
loving hands of Aunt Eloise. And the
years had passed until there came a time
when Winifred was married, and Eveley and
her aunt lived on alone, though always
happily.
</p>
<p>But investments had gone badly, and returns
went down as expenses went up. So
Eveley studied stenography, and took genuine
pleasure in her career as a business girl.
With her salary, and their modest income,
the two had managed nicely. Then when
Aunt Eloise went out to join her sister, the
Thorn Street house was left to Eveley, and
other property given to Winifred to compensate.
So that to Eveley it was only coming
home to return to the big house and the
rambling gardens. But to meet the expenses
of maintenance it was necessary that part of
the large house should be rented.
</p>
<p>Eveley, always adaptable, moved serenely
into her cote at the head of the stairs, and
felt that life was still kind and God was
good, for this was home, and it was hers, and
she had come to stay.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span></p>
<p>She almost regretted the impulsive promise
to her sister that drew her out of her
dwelling on the first night of her tenancy.
Not only did she begrudge the precious first-night
hours away from her pretty cote in the
clouds, but she was not charmed with the
arrangement for the evening. She was an
ardent devotee of clubs of action, rowing,
tennis, country, dancing and golf, but for
that other type of club, which she described
as &#8220;where a lot of women sit around with
their hats on, and drink tea, and have somebody
make speeches about things,&#8221; she felt
no innate tenderness.
</p>
<p>It was really a trick on the part of Winifred
that procured the promise of attendance. For
Eveley had been allowed to believe they were
going to play cards and that there would be
regular refreshments of substance, and perhaps
a little dancing later on. All this had
been submitted to by inference, without a
word of direct confirmation from Winifred,
who had a conscience.
</p>
<p>So it was that Eveley Ainsworth, irreproachably
attired in a new georgette blouse
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_34' name='page_34'></a>34</span>
and satin skirt, betook herself to her sister&#8217;s
home for an evening meeting of the Current
Club. And it was a decided shock to find that
neither a social game nor a soul-restoring
midnight supper were in store for her, but
the proverbial tea and speeches. She resigned
herself, however, to the inevitable, and
shrank back as obscurely as possible into a
dark corner where she might muse on the
charms of Nolan, the beauties of the new
Buddy Gillian, the martial dignity of Captain
Hardin, and the appeals of all the rest, to her
frivolous heart&#8217;s content.
</p>
<p>In this manner, she passed through the
first part of the evening very comfortably,
only dimly aware that she was floundering in
the outskirts of a perfect maze of big words
dealing with Americanization, which Eveley
vaguely understood to be something on the
order of standing up to <i>The Star Spangled
Banner</i>, and marching in parades with a flag
and shouting &#8220;Hurrah for the President,&#8221; in
the presence of foreigners.
</p>
<p>The third speaker was a minister, and ministers
are accustomed to penetrating the blue
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
mazes of mental abstraction. This minister
did. He began by telling three funny stories,
and Eveley, who loved to exercise her sense
of humor, came back to the Current Club
and joined their laughter.
</p>
<p>In the very same breath with which he
ended the last funny story, he began breezily
discoursing on everybody&#8217;s duty as a loyal
American. Eveley, to whom the word &#8220;duty&#8221;
was the original red rag, sniffed inaudibly but
indignantly to herself. And while she was
still sniffing the speaker left &#8220;duty as American
citizens&#8221; far behind, and was deep in the
intricacies of Americanization. Eveley found
to her surprise that this was something more
than saluting the flag and shouting. She
grew quite interested. It seemed that ordinary,
regular people were definitely, determinedly
working with little scraps of the foreign
elements, Chinese, Mexican, Russian,
Italian, yes, even German,&mdash;though Eveley
considered it asking entirely too much, even
of Heaven, to elevate shreds of German infamy
to American standards. At any rate,
people were doing this thing, taking the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
pliant, trusting mind of the foreigner, petting
it, training it, coaxing it,&mdash;until presently the
flotsam and jetsam of the Orient, of war-torn
Europe, of the islands of the sea, of all the
world, should be Americanized into union,
and strength, and loyalty, and love.
</p>
<p>It fascinated Eveley. She forgot that it
was her duty as a patriotic American. She
forgot that nobody had any business doing
anything but minding one&#8217;s own business.
She fairly burned to have a part in the work
of assimilation. Her eyes glowed with eagerness,
her cheeks flushed a vivid scarlet, her
lips trembled with the ecstatic passion of
loyalty.
</p>
<p>In the open discussion that followed after
the last address, Eveley suddenly, quite to
her own surprise, found that she had something
to say.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;isn&#8217;t it mostly talk?&#8221; she asked,
half shyly, anxious not to offend, but unable
to repress the doubt in her mind. &#8220;It does
not seem practical. You say we must assimilate
the foreign element. But can one assimilate
a foreign element? Doesn&#8217;t the fact that
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
it is foreign&mdash;make it impossible of assimilation?
Oh, I know we have to do something,
but as long as we are foreigners, we to them,
and they to us,&mdash;what can we do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The deadly silence that greeted her words
frightened her, yet somehow gave her courage
to go on. She must be saying something
rather sensible, or they would not pay attention.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can not assimilate food elements that
are foreign to the digestive organs,&#8221; she said.
&#8220;Labor and capital have warred for years,
and neither can assimilate the other. Look at
domestic conditions here,&mdash;in the home, you
know. People get married,&mdash;men and women,
of opposing types and interests and standards.
And they can not assimilate each
other, and the divorce courts are running
rampant. It does no good to say assimilation
is a duty, if it is impossible. And it
seems to be.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your criticism is destructive, Miss Ainsworth,&#8221;
said a learned professor who had
spoken first, and Eveley was sorry now that
she had not listened to him. &#8220;Destructive
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
criticism is never helpful. Have you anything
constructive to offer?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, maybe it is theoretic, also,&#8221; said
Eveley smiling faintly, and although the
smile was faint, it was Eveley&#8217;s own, which
could not be resisted. &#8220;But duty isn&#8217;t big
enough, nor adaptable enough, nor winning
enough. There must be some stronger force
to set in action. Nobody could ever win me
by doing his duty by me. It takes something
very intimate, very direct, and very personal
really to get me. But if one says a word, or
gives me a look,&mdash;just because he understands
me, and likes me,&mdash;well, I am his
friend for life. It takes a personal touch, a
touch that is guided not by duty but by love.
So I think maybe the foreign element is the
same way. We&#8217;ve got to sort of chum up with
it, and find out the nice things in it first.
They will find the nice things in us afterward.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But as you say, Miss Ainsworth, isn&#8217;t this
only talk? How would you go about chumming
up with the foreign element?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know, Professor,&#8221; she said
brightly. &#8220;But I think it can be done. And I
think it has to be done, or there can not be
any Americanization.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, are you willing to try your own
plan? We are conducting classes, games,
studies, among the foreigners, working with
them, teaching them, studying them. We call
this our duty as loyal Americans. You say
duty is not enough, and you want to get
chummy with them. Will you try getting
chummy and see where you come out?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley looked fearfully about the room, at
the friendly earnest faces. &#8220;I&mdash;I feel awfully
quivery in my backbone,&#8221; she faltered. &#8220;But
I will try it. You get me the foreigners, and
I will practise on them. And if I can&#8217;t get
chummy with them, and like them, why, I
shall admit you are right and I will help to
teach them spelling, and things.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>THE IRISH-AMERICAN LEAGUE</h3>
</div>

<p>Several days passed quietly. Eveley
went serenely about her work, and from
her merry manner one would never have suspected
the fires of Americanization smoldering
in her heart ready for any straying
breeze of opportunity to fan them into
service.
</p>
<p>She was finding it deliciously pleasant to
live in a Cloud Cote above a bride and groom.
Mrs. Bride, as Eveley fondly called her, was
the dainty, flowery, fluttery creature that
every bride should be. And Mr. Groom was
the soul of devotion and the spirit of tenderness.
To the world in general, they were
known as Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Severs, but
to Eveley, they were Mrs. Bride and Mr.
Groom. It served to keep their new and shining
matrimonial halo in mind.
</p>
<p>She was newly glad every morning that the
young husband had to start to his work before
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
she left home for hers. When she heard
the front door open down-stairs, she ran to
her window, often with a roll or her coffee
cup in her hand, to witness the departure,
which to her romantic young eyes was a real
event. Mrs. Bride always stood on the porch
to watch him on his way to the car until he
was out of sight. Sometimes she ran with
him to the corner, and always before he made
the turn he waved her a final good-by.
</p>
<p>It was very peaceful and serene. It seemed
hard to believe that recently there had been
a tremendous war, and that even now the
world was writhing in the throes of political
and social upheaval and change. In every
country, men and women were grappling
with great industrial problems, and there
were ominous rumblings and threatening
murmurs from society in revolution. But in
the rambling white house in the great green
gardens at the top of the canyon, one only
knew that it was springtime in southern California,
that the world was full of gladness
and peace and joy, and that love was paramount.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_42' name='page_42'></a>42</span></p>
<p>Several days,&mdash;and then one evening there
came the call of the telephone&mdash;the reveille
of Americanization in the person of Eveley
Ainsworth. A class of young foreign lads had
been gathered and would meet Eveley at the
Service League that evening. No instructions
were given, no suggestions were forthcoming.
Eveley had asked for foreigners with whom
she could get chummy and call it love. Here
were the foreigners. The rest of the plan
was Eveley&#8217;s own.
</p>
<p>She was proud of her mature comprehension
of the needs of reconstruction, and of
her utter gladness to assist. She felt that it
signified something rather fine and worth
while in her character, and she took no little
pleasure in the prospect of active service.
She went about her work that day wrapped
in a veil of mystery, her mind delving deep
into the ideals of American life. She carefully
elaborated several short and spicy
stories, of strong moral and patriotic tone,
emphasizing the nobility of love of country.
And that evening she stood before her mirror
for a long time, practising pretty flowery
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
phrases to be spoken with a most winsome
smile. Remembering that her subjects were
boys, and that boys are young men in the
making, she donned her daintiest, shimmeriest
gown, and carefully coaxed the enticing
little curls into prominence. Then with a final
patriotic smile at herself in the mirror, she
carefully climbed through the window and
crossed the roof garden to the rustic stairway.
</p>
<p>As she walked briskly up Albatross to Walnut,
then to Fourth where she took the car,
and all the way down-town she was carefully
rehearsing her stories and the most effective
modes of presenting them. She knew the
rooms of the Service League well, having
been there on many occasions while there
was still war and there were service men by
the hundreds to be danced with. Half a dozen
men and boys were lounging at the curbstone,
and they eyed her curiously, grimly,
Eveley thought. She wondered if they knew
she had come there to inspire them with love
of the great America which they must learn
to call home. She straightened her slim
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
shoulders at the thought, and walked into the
building with quite a martial air, as became
one on this high mission bent.
</p>
<p>A keen-eyed, quick-speaking woman met
her at the elevator, and led her back into
what she called &#8220;your corner&#8221; of the room.
Evidently the room was divided into countless
corners, for several groups were clustered
together in different sections. But Eveley
gave them only a fleeting glance. Her heart
and soul were centered on the group before
her, eight boys, dark-eyed, dark-skinned, of
fourteen years or thereabouts. They looked
at Eveley appraisingly, as we always look
on those who come to do us good. Eveley
looked upon them with tender solicitude, as
philanthropists have looked on their subjects
since the world was born.
</p>
<p>The introductions over, the keen-eyed one
hurried away and Eveley faced her sub-Americans.
</p>
<p>Then she smiled, a winsome smile before
which stronger men than they have fallen.
But they were curiously unsmiling in response.
Their eyes remained appraising almost
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
to the point of open suspicion. Perhaps
her very prettiness aroused the inherent opposition
of the male creature to female uplift.
</p>
<p>Eveley began, however, bravely enough,
and told them her first and prettiest story of
sacrifice and country love. They listened
gravely, but they were not thrilled. Struggling
against a growing sense of incompetence,
Eveley talked on and on, one story
after another, pretty word following pretty
word. But each word fell alike on stony
ground. They sat like graven images, except
for the bright suspicious gleam of the dark
eyes.
</p>
<p>Finally Eveley stopped, and turned to
them. &#8220;What do you think about it?&#8221; she demanded.
&#8220;You want to be Americans, don&#8217;t
you? You want to learn what being an American
means, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Her eyes were fastened
appealingly on a slender Russian lad,
slouching in his chair at the end of the row.
&#8220;You want to be an American, I know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suddenly the slim lithe figure straightened,
and the dark brows drew together in a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
frown. &#8220;What are you getting at?&#8221; came in
a sharp tone. &#8220;I&#8217;m an American, ain&#8217;t I?
You don&#8217;t take me for no German, do you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, of course not,&#8221; she apologized
placatingly. &#8220;Oh, certainly not. I mean, you
want to learn the things of America, so you
can love this country, and make it yours.
Then you will forget that other land from
which you came, and know this for your own,
now and forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley was arrested by the steady gleam
of a pair of eyes in the middle of the row.
There was open denial and disbelief written
in every feature and line of his face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; came the terse query, as Eveley
paused.
</p>
<p>Eveley gazed upon him in wonderment.
&#8220;Wh-what did you say?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said, why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, why not?&#8221; she countered nervously.
&#8220;This is your country now. You must love it
best in all the world, and must grow to be like
us,&mdash;one of us,&mdash;America for Americans only,
you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You tell us to forget the land we came
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span>
from,&#8221; he said in an even impersonal voice.
&#8220;Is that patriotism,&mdash;to forget the land of
your birth? I thought patriotism was to remember
your home-land,&mdash;holding it in your
heart,&mdash;hoping to return to it again,&mdash;and
make it better.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but that is not patriotism to this
country,&#8221; protested Eveley, aghast. &#8220;That is&mdash;disloyalty.
If you wish to be always of
your own land, and to love it best, you should
stay there. If you come here, to get our
training, our education, our development,
our riches,&mdash;then this must be your country,
and no other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked again. &#8220;Why should we
not come here and get all the good things you
can give us, and learn what you can teach us,
and take what money we can earn, and then
go back with all these good things to make
our own land bigger and better and richer?
That is patriotism, I think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; protested Eveley again. &#8220;That is
not loyalty. If you choose this country for
your home, it must be first in your heart, and
last also. This is your home-land now,&mdash;the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
land you believe in, the land of your love,
America first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But America was not first. The home-land
was first.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, it was first,&#8221; she admitted pacifically.
&#8220;But America is last. America is the final
touch. And so now you will learn our language,
our games, our business, our way of
life. You will live here, work here, and if war
comes again you will die for America.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she went on very quickly, fearful of
interruptions that were proving so disastrous.
&#8220;That is why we are organizing this
little club, you boys and I. We are going to
talk together. We are going to play together.
We are going to study together.
So you can learn American ways in all
things. Now what kind of club shall we
have? That is the American way of doing
things. It is not my club, but yours. You are
the people, and so you must decide.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A long and profound silence followed, evidently
indicative of deep thought.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A baseball club,&#8221; at last suggested a small
Jap with a bashful smile.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></p>
<p>&#8220;That is a splendid idea,&#8221; cried Eveley
brightly. &#8220;Baseball is a good American
sport, a clean, lively game. Now what shall
we call our baseball club?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again deep thought, but in a moment from
an earnest Jewish boy came the suggestion,
&#8220;The Irish-American Baseball League.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley searched his face carefully, looking
for traces of irony. But the pinched thin
features were earnest, the eyes alight with
pleased gratification at his readiness of retort.
</p>
<p>A hum of approval indicated that the
Irish-American League had met with favor.
But Eveley wavered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; she asked in puzzled tone.
&#8220;There is not an Irish boy here. You are
Italians, and Spanish, and Jewish, and Russian,
so why call it Irish-American?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My stepfather is an Irishman, his name
is Mike O&#8217;Malley,&#8221; said a small Mexican. &#8220;So
I&#8217;ll be the captain.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;G&#8217;wan, ain&#8217;t it enough to get the club
named for you?&#8221; came the angry retort.
&#8220;What you know about baseball, anyhow?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span></p>
<p>Eveley silenced them quickly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s just
call it the American League,&#8221; she pleaded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Irish-American League is well known,
and gets its name in the paper,&#8221; was the
ready argument in its favor.
</p>
<p>And this fact, together with the strong
appeal the words had made to their sense of
dignity, proved irresistible. They refused to
give it up. And when Eveley tried to reason
with them, they told her slyly that the proper
way to decide was by putting it to vote.
</p>
<p>Eveley swallowed hard, but conscientiously
admitted the justice of this, and put the
question to vote. And as the club was unanimously
in favor of it, and only Eveley was
opposed, her Americanization baseball club
of Italians and Mexicans and Orientals went
down into history as the Irish-American
League.
</p>
<p>When it came to voting for officers, she
again met with scant success. They flatly refused
to have a president, stating that a captain
could do all the bossing necessary, and
that baseball clubs always had a captain. In
the vote that followed the result was curiously
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
impartial. Every boy in the club voted
for himself. Eveley, who had been won by
the bright face of a young Jewish boy sitting
near her with keen eyes intent upon her,
voted for him, which gave him a fifty per
cent. majority over the nearest competitor,
and Eveley declared him the captain.
</p>
<p>A few moments later, Eveley was called
away to the telephone by Nolan, wishing to
know what time he should call for her and
the moment she was out of hearing, the club
went into noisy conference. Upon her return,
the argumentative Russian announced
that the vote had been changed, and he was
unanimously elected captain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how did that happen?&#8221; Eveley demanded
doubtfully. &#8220;Did the rest of you
change your votes, and decide he should be
captain?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a rustle of hesitation, almost a
dissenting murmur.
</p>
<p>The newly elected captain lowered his
brows ominously. &#8220;You did, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221; he
asked, glaring around on his fellow members.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; came feebly though unanimously.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did&mdash;did you vote?&#8221; questioned Eveley
tremulously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, we voted,&#8221; said the captain amiably.
&#8220;We decided that I know the game better
than the rest of the guys, and I can lick any
kid in this gang with one hand, and we decided
that I ought to be the captain. Ain&#8217;t
that right?&#8221; Again he turned lowering
brows on the Irish-American League.
</p>
<p>No denial was forthcoming, and although
Eveley felt assured that in some way the
American ideal of popular selection had been
violently outraged, it seemed the part of policy
to overlook what might have occurred.
Some minor rules were agreed upon, and the
club decided to meet for practise every evening
after school. Eveley could not attend
except on Saturdays, and a boy near her,
whose features had seemed vaguely and bewilderingly
familiar, announced that he must
withdraw as he worked and had no time for
baseball. The captain professed his ability
to fill up the club to the required number
with exceptional baseball material, and the
meeting adjourned without further parley.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span></p>
<p>This one meeting sufficed unalterably to
convince Eveley that she was totally and
helplessly out of her element. She was not
altogether sure those quick-witted boys
needed Americanizing, but she was sure that
she was not the one to do it if they did require
it. She realized that she had absolutely
no idea how to go about instilling principles
of freedom and loyalty in the hearts of
young foreigners.
</p>
<p>It was with great sadness that she began
adjusting her hat and collar ready to go
home, leaving defeat and failure behind her,
when a blithe voice at her elbow broke into
her despair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So long, Miss Ainsworth; see you in the
morning.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley whirled about and stared into the
face of the small lad whose features had
seemed so curiously familiar.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To-morrow?&#8221; she repeated.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Surest thing you know, at the office,&#8221; he
said, grinning impishly at her evident inability
to place him. &#8220;I knew all the time you
didn&#8217;t know me. I am Angelo Moreno, the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Number Three elevator boy at the Rollo
Building.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do&mdash;do you know who I am?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, you&#8217;re Miss Ainsworth, old Jim Hodgin&#8217;s
private secretary.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How long have you been there?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;About a year and a half.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never noticed,&#8221; she said, and there was
pain in her voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well,&#8221; he said soothingly, &#8220;there&#8217;s always
a jam going up and down when you do,
and you are tired evenings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you are in the jam, too, and you are
tired as well as I, but you have seen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s my job,&#8221; he said complacently. &#8220;I
got to know the folks in our building.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much do you know about me?&#8221; she
pursued with morbid curiosity.
</p>
<p>He grinned at her again, companionably.
&#8220;You&#8217;re twenty-five years old, and you&#8217;re
stuck on that fellow Inglish, with Morrow
and Mayne over at the Holland Building.
You used to live with your aunt up on Thorn
Street, but she died and you got the house.
B. T. Raines is your brother-in-law, and he&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
got two kids, but his wife is not as good-looking
as you are. You stayed with them
two months after your aunt died, but last
week you got a bunch of your beaux, soldiers
and things, to build you some steps up the
outside of your house and now you live up
there by yourself. Gee, I&#8217;d think you&#8217;d be
afraid of pirates and Greasers and things
coming up that canyon from the bay to rob
you&mdash;you being just a woman alone up
there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley gazed upon him in blank astonishment.
&#8220;Do&mdash;do you know that much about
everybody in our building?&#8221; she asked.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I know plenty about most of &#8217;em,
and some things that some of &#8217;em don&#8217;t know
I know, and wouldn&#8217;t be keen on having
talked around among strangers. But of
course I pays the most attention to the good-lookers,&#8221;
he admitted frankly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Eveley, with a faint
smile. Then she flushed. &#8220;What nerve for
me to talk of assimilation,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We
don&#8217;t know how to go about it. We have
been asleep and blind and careless and stupid,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
but you&mdash;why, you will assimilate us, if we
don&#8217;t look out. You are a born assimilator,
Angelo, do you know that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I guess so,&#8221; came the answer vaguely, but
politely. &#8220;I live about half a mile below you,
Miss Ainsworth, at the foot of the canyon on
the bay front. That&#8217;s all the diff there is
between us and you highbrows in Mission
Hills&mdash;about half a mile of canyon.&#8221; He
smiled broadly, pleased with his fancy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That isn&#8217;t much, is it, Angelo? And it
will be less pretty soon, now that we are trying
to open our eyes. Good night, Angelo.
I will see you to-morrow&mdash;really see you, I
mean. And please don&#8217;t assimilate me quite
so fast&mdash;you must give me time. I&mdash;I am
new to this business and progress very slowly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she said good night again, and went
away. And Angelo swaggered back to his
companions. &#8220;Gee, ain&#8217;t she a beaut?&#8221; he
gloated. &#8220;All the swells in our building is
nuts on that dame. But she gives &#8217;em all
the go-by.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the Irish-American League, without
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
the assimilator, went into a private session
with cigarettes and near-beer in a small
dingy room far down on Fifth Street&mdash;a session
that lasted far into the night.
</p>
<p>But Eveley Ainsworth did not know that.
She was sitting in the dark beside her window,
staring out at the lights that circled the
bay. But she did not see them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Assimilate the foreign element,&#8221; she
whispered in a frightened voice. &#8220;I am afraid
we can&#8217;t. It is too late. They got started
first&mdash;and they are so shrewd. But we&#8217;ve
got to do something, and quickly, or&mdash;they
will assimilate us, beyond a doubt. And
weren&#8217;t they right about it, after all? Isn&#8217;t
it patriotism and loyalty for them to go out
to foreign countries to pick up the finest and
best of our civilization and take it back to enrich
their native land? It is almost&mdash;blasphemous&mdash;to
teach them a new patriotism
to a new country. And yet we have to do it,
to make our country safe for us. But who
has brains enough and heart enough to do
it? Oh, dear! And they do not call it duty
that brings them here to take what we can
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
give them&mdash;they call it love&mdash;not love of us
and of America, but love of the little Wops
and the little Greasers and the little Polaks
in their own home-land. Oh, dear, such a
frightful mess we have got ourselves into.
And what a dunce I was to go to that silly
meeting and get myself mixed up in it.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>HER INHERITANCE</h3>
</div>

<p>The worries of the night never lived over
into the sunny day with Eveley, and
when she arose the next morning and saw
the amethyst mist lifting into sunshine, when
she heard the sweet ecstatic chirping of
little Mrs. Bride beneath, she smiled contentedly.
The world was still beautiful, and
love remained upon its throne.
</p>
<p>She started a little early for her work as
she was curious to see Angelo in the broad
light of day. It seemed so unbelievable that
those bright eyes and smiling lips had been
in the elevator with her many times a week
for many months, and that she had never
even seen them.
</p>
<p>So on the morning after her initiation into
the intricacies of Americanization, she
beamed upon him with almost sisterly affection.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good morning, Angelo. Isn&#8217;t this a wonderful
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
day? Whose secrets have you ferreted
out in the night while I was asleep?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Angelo flushed with pleasure, and shoved
some earlier passengers back into the car to
make room for her beside him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d be too sick to come this
morning,&#8221; he said, with his wide smile that
displayed two rows of white and even teeth.
&#8220;I thought it would take you twenty-four
hours to get over us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, not a bit of it,&#8221; she laughed. &#8220;And
I am equally glad to see that you are recovering
from your attack of me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This while the elevator rose, stopping at
each floor to discharge passengers.
</p>
<p>At the fifth floor Eveley passed out with a
final smile and a light friendly touch of her
hand on Angelo&#8217;s arm.
</p>
<p>This was the beginning of their strange
friendship, which ripened rapidly. Her
memory of that night in the Service League
with the Irish-American Club was very hazy
and dim. Except for the tangible presence
and person of Angelo, she might easily have
believed it was all a dream.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></p>
<p>In spite of her deep conviction that she was
not destined to any slight degree of success
as an Americanizer, Eveley conscientiously
studied books and magazines and attended
lectures on the subject, only to experience
deep grief as she realized that every additional
book, and article, and lecture, only
added to her disbelief in her powers of assimilation.
</p>
<p>So deep and absolute was her absorption,
that for some days she denied herself to her
friends, and remained wrapped in principles
of Americanization, which naturally caused
them no pleasure. And when a morning
came and she called a hasty meeting of her
four closest comrades, voicing imperative
needs and fervent appeals for help, she readily
secured four promises of attendance in the
Cloude Cote that evening at exactly seven-thirty.
</p>
<p>At seven-forty-five Eveley sat on the floor
beside the window impatiently tapping with
the absurd tip of an absurd little slipper.
Nolan had not come.
</p>
<p>Kitty Lampton was there, balancing herself
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span>
dangerously with two cushions on the
arm of a big rocker. Eveley called Kitty the
one drone in her circle of friendship, for
Kitty was born to golden spoons and lived a
life of comfort and ease and freedom from
responsibility in a great home with a doting
father, and two attentive maids. Eileen
Trevis was there, too, having arrived promptly
on the stroke of seven-thirty. Eileen
Trevis always arrived promptly on the stroke
of the moment she was expected. She was
known about town as a successful business
woman, though still in the early thirties.
The third of the group was Miriam Landis,
whose inexcusable marriage to her handsome
husband had seriously deranged the morale
of the little quartet of comrades.
</p>
<p>Eveley looked around upon them. &#8220;It is
a funny thing, a most remarkably funny
thing!&#8221; she said indignantly. &#8220;Every one
says that girls are always late, and you three,
except Eileen, are usually later than the
average late ones. Yet here you are. And every
one says that men are always prompt,
and Nolan is certainly worse than the average
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span>
man in every conceivable way. But
Nolan, where is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, go ahead and tell us the news anyhow,&#8221;
said Kitty, hugging the back of the
chair to keep from falling while she talked.
&#8220;But if it is anything about that funny Americanization
stuff, you needn&#8217;t tell it. I asked
father about it, and he explained it fully, only
he lost me in the first half of the first sentence.
So I don&#8217;t want to hear anything
more about it. And you don&#8217;t need to tell me
any more ways of not doing my duty, either,
for I am not doing it now as hard as I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miriam Landis leaned forward from the
couch where she was lounging idly. &#8220;What
is this peculiar little notion of yours about
duty, Eveley?&#8221; she asked, smiling. &#8220;My poor
child, all over town they are exploiting you
and your silly notions. Even my dear Lem
uses your disbelief in duty to excuse himself
for being out five nights a week.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is absurd,&#8221; said Eveley, flushing.
&#8220;And they may laugh all they like. I do believe
that duty has wrecked more homes and
ruined more lives than&mdash;than vampires.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_64' name='page_64'></a>64</span></p>
<p>Miriam smiled tolerantly. &#8220;Wait till you
get married, sweetest,&#8221; she said softly. &#8220;If
married women did not believe in duty, and
do it, no marriage would last more than six
months.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I qualify myself, you know,&#8221; said
Eveley excusingly. &#8220;I do think everybody
has one duty&mdash;but only one&mdash;and it isn&#8217;t the
one most people think it is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For the sake of my immortal soul, tell
me,&#8221; pleaded Kitty. &#8220;It was you who led me
into the dutiless paths. Now lead me back.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up, Kitty, and don&#8217;t be silly,&#8221; said
Eveley loftily. &#8220;This is not a driven duty,
but a spontaneous one. And you don&#8217;t need
to know what it is, for it comes naturally, or
it doesn&#8217;t come at all. Isn&#8217;t that Nolan the
most aggravating thing that ever lived?
Eight o&#8217;clock. And he promised for seven-thirty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on and tell us, Eveley,&#8221; said Eileen
Trevis. &#8220;Maybe somebody is sick, and has to
make a will, and he won&#8217;t be here all night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I can&#8217;t tell it twice. You know how
many questions Nolan always asks, and besides
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
I want to surprise you all in a bunch.
Look, did I show you the new blouse I got
to-day? I needed a new one to Americanize
my Irish-Americans Saturday. It cost ten
dollars, and perfectly plain&mdash;but I look like a
sad sweet dream in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the girls were absorbed in a discussion
of the utter impossibility of bringing
next month&#8217;s allowance or salary within
speaking distance of last month&#8217;s bills, a subject
which admitted of no argument but
which interested them deeply. So after all
they did not hear the rumble and creak of the
rustic stairway, nor the quick steps crossing
the garden on the roof of the sun parlor for
Nolan was forgotten until his sharp tap on
the glass was followed by the instant appearance
of his head, and his pleasant voice said
in tones of friendly raillery:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Every time I climb those wabbly rattly-bangs
that you call rustic stairs, I wonder
that you have a friend to your name. Hello,
Eveley.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Inasmuch as you made the wabbliest pair
of all, and since you climb them more than
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
anybody else, you haven&#8217;t much room to
talk,&#8221; returned Eveley tartly, drawing back
the portières to admit his entrance, which
was no laughing matter for a large man.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You positively are the latest thing that
ever was,&#8221; she went on, as he landed with a
heavy thud.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? Why, I am the soul of punctuality.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be the soul of it, but punctuality
does not get far with a soul minus willing
feet.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Anyhow, I am here, and that is something,&#8221;
he said, making the rounds of the
room to shake hands cordially with the other
girls.
</p>
<p>Eveley hopped up quickly on to the small
desk&mdash;shoving the telephone off, knowing
Nolan would catch it, as indeed he did with
great skill, having been catching telephones
and vases and books for Eveley for five full
years. She clasped her hands together, glowing,
and her friends leaned toward her expectantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have called you together,&#8221; she began in
a high, slightly imperious voice, &#8220;my four
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
best friends, counting Nolan, because I need
advice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you wish to retain me as counsellor?&#8221;
asked Nolan, with a strong legal accent
&#8220;My fee&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not wish to retain you in any capacity,&#8221;
Eveley interrupted quickly. &#8220;My chief
worry is how to dispose of you satisfactorily.
And as for fees&mdash;Pouf! Anyhow, I need advice,
good advice, deep advice, loving advice.
So I have called you into solemn conclave,
and because it is a most exceptional occasion
I have prepared refreshments, good ones,
sandwiches and coffee and cake&mdash;Did you
bring the cake, Kit? And ice-cream&mdash;the
drug-store is going to deliver it at ten, only
the boy won&#8217;t climb the stairs; you&#8217;ll have to
meet him at the bottom, Nolan. So I hope
you realize that it is an affair of some moment,
and not&mdash;Miriam Landis, are you
asleep?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miriam flashed her eyes wide open, denial
on her lips, but Kitty forestalled her. &#8220;That
is a pose,&#8221; she explained. &#8220;Billy Ferris said,
and I told Miriam he said it, that with her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span>
eyes closed, she is the loveliest thing in the
world. And since then she walks around in
her sleep half the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miriam turned toward her, still more indignant
denial clamoring for utterance, but
Eveley, accepting the explanation as reasonable,
went quickly on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now I want you to be very serious and
thoughtful&mdash;can you concentrate better in
the dark, Kit? Because I know at seances
and things they turn off the lights, and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s do. And we&#8217;ll all hold hands,
and concentrate, and maybe we&#8217;ll scare up a
ghost or something.&#8221; Then she looked
around the room&mdash;four girls and Nolan&mdash;Nolan,
who had edged with alacrity toward
Eveley on the telephone desk&mdash;and Kitty
shrugged her shoulders. &#8220;Oh, what&#8217;s the
use? Never mind. Go on with the gossip,
Eveley. I can think with the lights on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The ice-cream will be here before we get
started,&#8221; said Eileen Trevis suddenly.
</p>
<p>Eveley clasped her hands again and smiled.
&#8220;I have received a fortune. Somebody died&mdash;you
needn&#8217;t advise me to wear mourning,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
either, Miriam. I never saw him in my life,
and never even heard of him, and honestly
I think he got me mixed up with somebody
else and left the fortune to the wrong grand-niece,
but anyhow it is none of my business,
and since he is dead and the money is here,
I suppose there is no chance of his discovering
the mistake and making me refund it
after it is spent.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A fortune,&#8221; gasped Kitty, tumbling off the
arm of the chair and rushing to fling herself
on the floor beside Eveley, warm arms embracing
her knees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Root of all evil,&#8221; murmured Miriam, gazing
into space through half-closed lids, and
seeing wonderful visions of complexions and
permanent curls and a manicure every day.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How fortunate,&#8221; said Eileen in a voice
pleased though still unruffled and even. &#8220;A
fortune means safety and protection and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the dickens has been butting into
your affairs now?&#8221; demanded Nolan peevishly,
and though the girls laughed, there was
no laughter in his eyes and no smile on his
lips.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since he calls me his great-niece, I
suppose he is my grand-uncle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How much, lovey, how much?&#8221; gurgled
Kitty, at her side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Twenty-five hundred dollars,&#8221; announced
Eveley ecstatically.
</p>
<p>Nolan breathed again. &#8220;Oh, that isn&#8217;t so
bad. I thought maybe some simp had left
you a couple of millions or so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley fairly glared upon him. &#8220;What do
you mean by that? Why a simp? Why
shouldn&#8217;t I be left a couple of millions as well
as anybody else? Maybe you think I haven&#8217;t
sense enough to spend a couple of millions.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And why did you require advice?&#8221; Eileen
queried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes.&#8221; Eveley smiled again. &#8220;Yes, of
course. Now you must all think desperately
for a while&mdash;I hate to ask so much of you,
Nolan&mdash;but perhaps this once you won&#8217;t mind&mdash;I
want you to tell me what to do with the
money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was indeed a serious responsibility.
What to do with twenty-five hundred dollars?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You do not feel it is your duty to spend
the twenty-five hundred pounding Americanism
into your Irish-American Wops?&#8221; asked
Nolan facetiously.
</p>
<p>Eveley took this good-naturedly. &#8220;Oh, I
got off from work at four-thirty and went
down to their field, and we had a celebration.
We had ice-cream and candy and chewing
gum, and I spent twenty-five dollars
equipping them with balls and bats and
since I was with them an hour and a quarter,
I feel that I am entitled to the rest of the
fortune myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, dearie,&#8221; said Eileen, &#8220;it is really
very simple. Put it in a savings account, of
course. Keep it for a rainy day. You may
be ill. You may get married&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t she get married without twenty-five
hundred dollars?&#8221; asked Nolan, with great
indignation. &#8220;She doesn&#8217;t expect to buy her
own groceries when she gets married, does
she?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She may have to, Nolan,&#8221; said Eileen gently.
&#8220;One never knows what may happen
after marriage. Getting married is no laughing
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
matter, and Eveley should be prepared
for any exigency.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Eileen, she won&#8217;t need her twenty-five
hundred to get married. No decent fellow
would marry a girl unless he could support
her, and do it well, even luxuriously.
You don&#8217;t suppose I would let my wife spend
her twenty-five hundred&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean me, I shall do whatever I
like with my own money when I get married,&#8221;
said Eveley quickly. &#8220;My husband will
have nothing to say about it. You needn&#8217;t
think for one minute&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not your husband, am I? I haven&#8217;t
exactly proposed to you yet, have I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley swallowed hard. &#8220;Certainly not.
And probably never will. By the time you
get around to it, getting married will be out
of date, and none of the best people doing it
any more.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may not have asked her, Nolan,&#8221; said
Eileen evenly. &#8220;And that is your business,
of course. She will probably turn you down
when you do ask her, just as she does everybody
else. But&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who has been asking her now?&#8221; he cried,
with jealous interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But while we are on the subject, I hope
you will permit me to say that I think your
principles are all wrong, and even dangerous.
You think a man should wait a thousand
years until he can keep a wife like a pet dog,
on a cushion with a pink ribbon around her
neck&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The dog&#8217;s neck, or the wife&#8217;s?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The dog&#8217;s&mdash;no, the wife&#8217;s&mdash;both of them,&#8221;
she decided at last, with never a ruffle. &#8220;You
want to wait until she is tired of loving, and
too old to have a good time, and worn out
with work. It isn&#8217;t right. It is not fair.
It is unjust both to yourself, and to Eve&mdash;to
the girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, my dear child,&#8221; he said. Eileen was
three years older than Nolan; but being a
lawyer he called all women &#8220;child.&#8221; &#8220;My
dear child, do you realize that my salary is
eighteen hundred a year, and I get only a few
hundred dollars in fees. Think of the cost of
food these days, and of clothes, and amusements,
to say nothing of rent! Do you think
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
I would allow Eve&mdash;my wife, to go without
the sweet things of&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t bring me in,&#8221; said Eveley
loftily. &#8220;I have never accepted you, have I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not exactly, I suppose, but&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eveley,&#8221; said Miriam, suddenly sitting
erect on the couch. &#8220;I have it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sounds like the measles,&#8221; said Kitty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I mean I know what to do with the money.
Listen, dear. You do not want to go on slaving
in an office until you are old and ugly.
And Nolan is quite right, you certainly can
not marry a grubby clerk in a law office.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan laughed at that, but Eveley sat up
very straight indeed and fairly glowered at
her unconscious friend on the couch.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must have the soft and lovely things
of life, and the way to get them is to marry
them. Now, sweet, you take your twenty-five
hundred, be manicured and massaged and
shampooed until you are glowing with
beauty, buy a lot of lovely clothes, trip
around like a lady, dance and play, and meet
men&mdash;men with money&mdash;and there you are.
You can look like a million dollars on your
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_75' name='page_75'></a>75</span>
twenty-five hundred&mdash;and your looks will get
you the million by marriage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miriam Landis, that is shameful,&#8221; said
Nolan in a voice of horror. &#8220;It is disgraceful.
I never thought to hear a woman, a
married woman, a nice woman, utter such
low and grimy thoughts. Could any such
marriage be happy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Nolan,&#8221; said Miriam sadly, &#8220;I am
not sure that any marriage can be happy, or
was ever supposed to be. But women are such
that they have to try it once. Eveley will
be like all the rest. And if she has to try it,
she had better try it with a million, than with
eighteen hundred a year.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something in that, Miriam, certainly,&#8221;
said Eveley thoughtfully. &#8220;What do
you think, Eileen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it is absurd. The notion that
woman was born for marriage died long ago.
Ridiculous! Woman is born for life, for service,
for action, just as man is. Look at the
married people you know. How many of
them are happy? I do not wish to be personal,
but I know very few married people,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span>
either men or women, who would not be glad
to undo the marriage knot if it could be done
easily and quietly without notoriety. They
are not happy. But we are happy. Why?
Because we work, we think, we feel, we live.
We are not slaves to the contentment of man.
Go on working, my dear. Keep your independence.
But play safe. Put your money
in the bank, or in some good investment, and
let it safeguard your future. Then you can
go your way serene.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is certainly sound. Marriage isn&#8217;t
the most successful thing in the world.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; chimed Kitty. &#8220;Husbands
are always tired of wives, their own,
I mean, inside of five years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, if it comes to that,&#8221; said Eveley honestly,
&#8220;I suppose wives are tired of their own
husbands, too. But they are so stubborn
they won&#8217;t admit it. In their hearts I suppose
they are quite as sick of their husbands
as their husbands are of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eve,&#8221; said Nolan anxiously, &#8220;where are
you getting all these wicked notions? Marriage
is the most sacred&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Institution. I know it. Every one says
marriage is a sacred institution, and so is a
church. But nobody wants to live with one
permanently.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Eveley, the sanctity of the&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Home. Sure, we know it is sanctified.
But monotonous. Deadly monotonous.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eve,&#8221; and his voice was quite tragic,
&#8220;don&#8217;t you feel that the divine sphere of&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Woman. You needn&#8217;t finish it, Nolan; we
know it as well as you do. The divine sphere
of woman is in the sanctified home keeping
up the sacred institution of marriage while
her husband&mdash;oh, tralalalalalala.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir, I&#8217;ll go you,&#8221; cried Kitty suddenly,
leaping up from the floor, and waving
her hand. &#8220;Europe! You and I together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She has come to,&#8221; said Eileen resignedly.
&#8220;There&#8217;s an end of sensible talk for this evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Kit, what is it? I knew you would
think of something good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll go to Europe, you and I. I think I
can work dad to let me go. I can pretend to
fall in love with the plumber, or somebody,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
and he&#8217;ll be glad to trot me off for a while.
And he likes you, Eveley. He thinks you are
so sensible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he hardly knows me,&#8221; cried Eveley,
astonished.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is why. I tell him how sensible
you are when you are not there, and when he
gets home I hustle you out of his sight in a
hurry. He likes me to have sensible friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what shall we do with the money?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Travel, travel, travel, and have a gay good
time,&#8221; said Kitty blithely. &#8220;All over Europe.
We&#8217;ll get some handsome clothes, and have
the time of our lives as long as the money
lasts, and then marry dukes or princes or
something like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Two of you,&#8221; shouted Nolan furiously.
&#8220;Well, Eve, it is a good thing you have
one friend to give you really decent advice.
Of all idiotic ideas. Buy fine clothes and
marry a millionaire. Save it to pay for potatoes
when you get a husband that can&#8217;t support
you. Travel to Europe and marry some
purple prince.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why purple?&#8221; asked Eveley curiously.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean clothed in purple and fine
linen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you mean blood, it is blue,&#8221; said Kitty.
&#8220;Blue-blooded princes. Whoever heard of a
purple-blooded prince?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What did you mean anyhow, Nolan?&#8221;
asked Eileen.
</p>
<p>Driven into a corner, Nolan hesitated. He
had said purple on the spur of the moment,
chiefly because it sounded derogatory and
went well with prince.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What I really mean,&#8221; he began in a dispassionate
legislative voice, &#8220;what I really
mean is&mdash;purple in the face. You know,
purple, splotchy skin, caused by eating too
much rich food, drinking too much strong
wine, playing cards and dancing and flirting.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does flirting make you purple?&#8221; gasped
Miriam. &#8220;It does not show on Lem yet.&#8221;
And then she subsided quickly, hoping they
had not noticed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Nolan, I have danced for weeks and
weeks at a stretch, evenings, I mean, when
the service men were here,&#8221; said Kitty, &#8220;and
I am not purple yet.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, rats,&#8221; said Nolan. Then he brightened.
&#8220;You have never seen a prince, so of
course you do not understand. Wait till you
see one. Then a purple prince will mean
something in your young life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should not like to marry a purple creature,&#8221;
said Eveley, wrinkling her nose distastefully.
&#8220;I am too pink. And my blue
eyes would clash with a purple husband, too.
But maybe the dukes and lords are a different
shade,&#8221; she finished hopefully.
</p>
<p>Nolan turned his back, and lit a cigarette.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you may smoke, Nolan, by all means.
I always like my guests to be comfortable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is your advice then, Nolan? You
are so scornful about our suggestions,&#8221; said
Eileen quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know what Nolan would like,&#8221; said Kitty
spitefully. &#8220;He would advise Eveley to give
him the money and make him her executor
and appoint him her guardian. That would
suit him to a T.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My poor infant, Eveley can not use an
executor and a guardian at the same time.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
One comes in early youth, or old age, the
other after death. An executor&mdash;&#8221; he began,
clearing his throat as for a prolonged
technical explanation.
</p>
<p>Kitty plunged her fingers into her ears.
&#8220;You stop that right now, Nolan Inglish.
We came here to advise Eveley, not for you
to practise on. If you begin that I shall
go straight home&mdash;no, I mean I shall go out
on the steps and wait for the ice-cream.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What do you advise, Nolan?&#8221; persisted
Eileen.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, my personal advice is, and I strongly
urge it, and plead it, and it will make me
very happy, and&mdash;?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He wants to borrow it,&#8221; gasped Kitty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Go on, Nolan,&#8221; urged Eveley eagerly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it in the bank on your checking account.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Put it&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Checking account?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, right in your checking account.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A slow scornful light dawned in Eileen&#8217;s
eyes. &#8220;I see,&#8221; she said coldly. &#8220;Very selfish,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
very unprofessional, very unfriendly. He
would have his lady love absolutely bankrupt,
that he may endow her with all the goods of
life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Nolan,&#8221; said Eveley weakly, lacking
Eileen&#8217;s sharper perception, &#8220;don&#8217;t you know
me well enough to realize that if I put it into
my checking account it will be gone, absolutely
and everlastingly gone, inside of six
months, and not a thing to show for it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know it,&#8221; he admitted humbly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And still you advise it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not advise it&mdash;I just want it,&#8221; he admitted
plaintively.
</p>
<p>Eveley sat quietly for a while, counting
her fingers, her lips moving once in a while,
forming such words as marriage, travel,
princes and banks. Then she clapped her
hands and beamed upon them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lovely,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Exquisite! Just
what I wanted to do myself! You are dear
good faithful friends, and wise, too, and you
will never know how much your advice has
helped me. Then it is all settled, isn&#8217;t it?
And I shall buy an automobile.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_83' name='page_83'></a>83</span></p>
<p>In a flash, she caught up a pillow, holding
it out sharply in front of her, whirling it
around like a steering wheel, while she
pushed with both feet on imaginary clutches
and brakes, and honked shrilly.
</p>
<p>But her friends leaned weakly back in their
chairs and stared. Then they laughed, and
admitted it was what they had expected all
the time.

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>A WRONG ADJUSTMENT</h3>
</div>

<p>Eveley&#8217;s resolve to spend her fortune
for an auto met with less resistance
than she had anticipated. It seemed that
every one had known all along that she would
fool the money away on something, and a
motor was far more reasonable than some
things.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I said travel,&#8221; said Kitty. &#8220;And we can
travel in a car as well as on a train&mdash;more
fun, too. And though it may cut us off from
meeting a purple prince&mdash;a pretty girl with
a car of her own is a combination no man
can resist. And maybe if we are very patient
and have good luck, we may save a millionaire
from bandits, or rescue a daring aviator
from capture by Mexicans.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miriam nodded, also, her eyes cloudy behind
the dark lashes. &#8220;Very nice, dear. Get
a lot of stunning motor things and&mdash;irresistible,
simply irresistible. You must have a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
red leather motor coat. You will be adorable
in one. But you&#8217;ll have to shake Nolan, dear.
You stand no chance in the world if you are
constantly herded by a disagreeable young
lawyer, guardianing you from every truant
glance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t at all bad,&#8221; quickly interposed
Eileen. &#8220;I believe that more than anything
else in the world, a motor-car reconciles a
woman to life without a husband. She gets
thrills in plenty, and retains her independence
at the same time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eileen,&#8221; put in Nolan sternly, &#8220;I am disappointed
in you. A woman of your ability
and experience trying to prejudice a young
and innocent girl against marriage is&mdash;is&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are awfully hard to suit, Nolan,&#8221;
complained Eveley gently. &#8220;You shouted at
Miriam and Kitty for advising a husband,
and now you roar at Eileen for advising
against one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t the husband I object to&mdash;it is
their cold-blooded scheme to go out and pick
one up. Woman should be sought&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when Eveley gets a car she&#8217;ll be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
sought fast enough,&#8221; said Kitty shrewdly.
&#8220;She hasn&#8217;t suffered from any lack of admirers
as it is, but when she goes motoring
on her own&mdash;<i>ach</i>, Louie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you approve of the car, do you,
Nolan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since I can not think of any quicker
or pleasanter way of spending the money,&#8221;
he said slowly, &#8220;I may say that I do, unequivocally.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why unequivocally?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s it mean, anyhow?&#8221; demanded
Kitty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you talk English, Nolan?&#8221; asked
Eveley, in some exasperation. &#8220;You started
off as if you were in favor, but now heaven
only knows what you mean.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get your car, my poor child, by all means.
Get your car. But a dictionary is what you
really need.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rest of the evening they were enthusiastic
almost to the point of incoherency.
Kitty was in raptures over an exquisite red
racer she had seen on the street. Miriam described
Mary Pickford&#8217;s rose-upholstered car,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
and applied it to Eveley&#8217;s features. Nolan
developed a surprisingly intimate knowledge
of carburetors, horse-powers and cylinders.
</p>
<p>When at last they braved the rustic stairway,
homeward bound, with exclamatory
gasps and squeals, gradually drifting away
into silence, Eveley sat down on the floor to
take off her shoes&mdash;a most childish habit carried
over into the years of age and wisdom&mdash;and
was immediately wrapped in happy
thoughts where stunning motor clothes and
whirring engines and Nolan&#8217;s pleasant eyes
were harmoniously mingled. And when at
last she started up into active consciousness
again, and rushed pellmell to bed, mindful of
her responsibility as a business girl, sleep
came very slowly. And when it came at last,
it was a chaotic jumble of excited dreams
and tossings.
</p>
<p>The life of the bride and groom in the nest
beneath Eveley&#8217;s Cloud Cote had progressed
so sweetly and smoothly that Eveley had
come to feel it was quite a friendly dispensation
of Providence that permitted her to live
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
one story up from Honeymooning. So the
next morning, in the midst of the confusion
that came from dressing and getting her
breakfast and reading motor ads in the morning
paper at the same time, she was utterly
electrified to hear a sudden sharp cry of
anguish from little Mrs. Bride beneath&mdash;a
cry accompanied by sounds caused by nothing
in the world but a passionate and hysterical
pounding of small but violent feet upon
the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oooooh, oooooh, don&#8217;t talk to me, Dody,
I can&#8217;t bear it. I can&#8217;t, I can&#8217;t. Ooooh, I
wish I were dead. Go away, go away this instant
and let me die. Oh, I shall run away,
I shall kill myself! Oooooh!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dearie, sweetie, don&#8217;t,&#8221; begged Mr. Groom
distractedly. &#8220;Lovie, precious, please.&#8221; And
his voice faded off into tender inarticulate
whispers.
</p>
<p>For a long second Eveley was speechless.
Then she said aloud, very grimly, &#8220;Hum.
It has begun. I suppose I may look for flat-irons
and rolling-pins next. Hereafter they
are Mr. and Mrs. Ordinary Married People.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span></p>
<p>After long and patient, demonstrative
pleading on his part, Mrs. Severs was evidently
restored to a semblance of reason and
content, and quiet reigned for a while until
the slam of the door indicated that Mr. Severs
had heeded the call of business.
</p>
<p>Almost immediately there came a quick
creaking of the rustic stairs and a light tap
on Eveley&#8217;s window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in,&#8221; she called pleasantly. &#8220;I sort
of expected you. You will excuse me, won&#8217;t
you, for not getting up, but I have only fifteen
minutes to finish my breakfast and
catch the car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are awfully businesslike, aren&#8217;t
you?&#8221; asked Mrs. Severs admiringly. &#8220;Yes,
I will have a cup of coffee, thanks. I need
all the stimulation I can get.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was pale, and her eyes were red-rimmed,
Eveley noted commiseratingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are expecting an addition to our family
this afternoon, Miss Ainsworth,&#8221; she began,
her chin quivering childishly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy!&#8221; gasped Eveley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Our father-in-law,&#8221; added Mrs. Severs
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span>
quickly. &#8220;Dody&#8217;s father. He is coming to
live with us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; breathed Eveley. &#8220;Won&#8217;t that be
lovely?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Severs burst into passionate weeping.
&#8220;It won&#8217;t be lovely,&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;It
will be ghastly.&#8221; She sat up abruptly and
wiped her eyes. &#8220;He is the most heart-breaking
thing you ever saw, and he doesn&#8217;t
like me. He doesn&#8217;t approve of dimples, and
he says I am soft. And he has the most desperate
old chum you ever saw, a perfect
wreck with red whiskers, and they get together
every night and play pinochle and
smoke smelly old pipes, and he won&#8217;t have
curtains in his bedroom, and he is crazy
about a phonograph, and he won&#8217;t eat my
cooking.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should think you would like that,&#8221; said
Eveley. &#8220;Maybe he will cook for himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is just it,&#8221; wailed Mrs. Severs. &#8220;He
does. He cooks the smelliest kind of corn
beef and cabbage, and eats liver by the&mdash;by
the cow, and has raw onions with every meal.
And he drinks tea by the gallon. And he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_91' name='page_91'></a>91</span>
cooks everything himself and piles it on his
plate like a mountain and carries it to the
table and sits there and eats it right before
company and everybody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how Mr. Severs ever came to
have a father like that,&#8221; said Eveley in open
surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, the funny thing about it is that he
would really be very nice if he wasn&#8217;t so outrageous.
And he swears terribly. He says
&#8216;Holy Mackinaw&#8217; at everything. But he
loves Dody. They lived together for years,
and it nearly killed him when Dody got married.
And Dody said, &#8216;You will live with us
of course, father,&#8217; and so we expected it. But
he went off for a visit after we were married&mdash;he
and the red-whiskered friend, and we
sort of thought&mdash;we kind of hoped&mdash;miracles
do happen, you know&mdash;and so I just kept believing
that something would turn up to save
us. But it didn&#8217;t. Dody got a letter this
morning, and he will be here this afternoon.
Oh, I wish I were dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is he terribly poor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mercy, no! He&#8217;s got plenty of money.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
Lots more than we have. Enough to live anywhere
he pleases.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I see it all,&#8221; said Eveley ominously. &#8220;You
won&#8217;t be happy with him, and he won&#8217;t be
happy with you, but you are all putting up
with it because it is your&mdash;duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, that is it, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley poured herself another cup of coffee
and drank it rapidly, without cream, and
only one lump of sugar. &#8220;I am upset,&#8221; she
said at last. &#8220;This has simply shattered the
day for me. Excuse me, you&#8217;ll have to hurry,
I only have five minutes left. I haven&#8217;t explained
my belief and principles to you&mdash;you
being young and newly married and needing
all the illusions possible&mdash;but I do not believe
in duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Gracious,&#8221; gasped the bride. &#8220;You
don&#8217;t?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Absolutely not. No human being should
do his duty under any conceivable circumstances.
You see, there are two kinds, the
pleasurable ones, and the painful ones.
Pleasurable duties are done, not because they
are duties, but because they are pleasurable.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
So they do not count. And a painful duty can
not be a duty or it would not be painful. My
idea is, that there must be a happy adjustment
of every necessity, so when a duty is
painful, it is the wrong adjustment. You and
your father-in-law are giving yourselves pain
because it is the wrong adjustment.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It sounds very clever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is the only beautiful plan of life,&#8221; said
Eveley modestly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And then we would not have to live with
father at all?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Most certainly not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is a glorious theory,&#8221; said
the bride enthusiastically. &#8220;You explain it
to Dody, will you? He is positively death
on duty, especially when it is painful. He&#8217;d
do his duty if it killed him and me, burned
the house down and started a revolution.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have to go now,&#8221; said Eveley. &#8220;Excuse
me for rushing you off, but I am late already.
I&#8217;ll explain it to you another time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Very skilfully she piloted her caller out
the window and down the rustic steps.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Remember this,&#8221; she said as they reached
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
the bottom. &#8220;As long as duty is painful, it
is not a duty and can not be. Now find another
adjustment. That is the end of it.&#8221;
And she started on a quick trot for the corner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But father will be here this afternoon
just the same,&#8221; called Mrs. Severs after her
in mournful tones.
</p>
<p>Being very businesslike, Eveley made a
set of notes about the case on her way down-town.
</p>
<p>Liver and cabbage.
</p>
<p>Raw onions.
</p>
<p>Smelly pipe.
</p>
<p>Red-whiskered friend.
</p>
<p>Pinochle.
</p>
<p>Hates dimples. (I&#8217;ll keep my left side
turned his way.)
</p>
<p>Money enough to live on.
</p>
<p>Crazy about Dody&mdash;christened Andrew.
</p>
<p>Dody believes in duty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it is up to me to save them,&#8221;
she decided cheerfully, and was quite happy
at the prospect of an engagement in her
campaign. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t neglect getting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
my car, even to save human nature from its
duty,&#8221; she added. And then her mind wandered
from the duties of brides, to the pleasures
of young motorists.
</p>
<p>Her plan of expenditure was most lucid.
She would invest eighteen hundred dollars
in a car, and spend two hundred for clothes
&#8220;to sustain the illusion.&#8221; Nolan did not understand
exactly what she meant by that,
but on general principles was convinced it
was something reprehensible and sneered at
it. The other five hundred was to be deposited
in the bank as a guarantee for future
tires and gasoline and repairs. Nolan said
that according to his information it would be
wiser to buy a second-hand car for five hundred,
and keep the eighteen hundred for
tires and gas and repairs.
</p>
<p>But Nolan was a struggling young lawyer&mdash;even
more struggling than young&mdash;and the
girls were accustomed to his pessimistic murmurs,
and gave them no heed at all.
</p>
<p>Although Eveley had determined to confine
herself to eighteen hundred dollars for
the car, she was not morally above accepting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
demonstrations of cars entailing twice, and
even thrice, that expenditure. &#8220;For,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;for all I know somebody else may die
and leave me some more, and then I can get
an expensive one. And besides, I feel it is
my duty&mdash;oh, no, I mean I feel it would be
lots of fun, as a conscientious and enthusiastic
motorist to know the good points of
every car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Nolan assured her of his complete support
and assistance in her search, even to the
detriment of his labors at the law office,
where he hoped one day to be a member of
considerable standing. Nolan had two fond
dreams&mdash;to become a regular member of the
firm, and to marry Eveley. They were closely
related, one to the other. If he could not
marry Eveley, he had no desire for a partnership
nor anything else but speedy death. But
until he had the partnership, he felt himself
morally obligated to deny himself Eveley in
the flesh. For he was one of those unique,
old-fashioned creatures who feels that man
must offer position and affluence as well as
love to the lady of his choice. So it was no
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span>
mere mercenary madness on his own account
that kept Nolan living a life of gentle and
economic obscurity, patient struggling for a
foothold on the ladder of fame in his profession.
</p>
<p>He knew better than to propose to Eveley.
He realized that if they were once formally
and blissfully engaged, he, being only mortal
man with human frailties, could never resist
the charm of complete possession, and he
foresaw that betrothal would end in speedy
marriage to the death of his determination
to bring his goddess glory.
</p>
<p>Thus Nolan&#8217;s lips were sealed&mdash;on the subject
of marriage. &#8220;Though goodness knows,
he has plenty to say about everything else,&#8221;
Eveley sometimes complained rather plaintively.
And his attentions took the form of a
more or less pleasant watch-dog constancy,
and an always more and never less persistence
in warding off other suitors not handicapped
by his own scruples in regard to matrimony.

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>PAINFUL DUTY</h3>
</div>

<p>When Eveley arrived home late that
night she smiled to observe that all
the down-stairs windows were wide open to
the breeze, and in the corner bedroom, apportioned
to Father-in-law, the curtains were
down. At the back of the house she found
Father-in-law himself, with the proverbial
whiskered friend, critically inspecting her
rustic steps through the clouds of smoke
from their pipes which they removed to facilitate
their interested stares as she approached.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How do you do?&#8221; she cried brightly.
&#8220;You are Mr. Severs, Senior, aren&#8217;t you?
Welcome home! And this is your friend, I
know.&#8221; She shook hands with them both,
with great cordiality. She must disarm
them, before she could begin working them
into a proper adjustment with life. &#8220;I am
Eveley Ainsworth. Are you admiring my
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_99' name='page_99'></a>99</span>
steps? I am very eccentric and temperamental
and all that, and I have to live alone.
I do not like being crowded in with other
folks. I like to do as I please, and not bother
with anybody else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very sensible, I&#8217;m sure,&#8221; said Father-in-law.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; echoed the whiskered one breezily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the first little seed,&#8221; she chuckled
to herself, as she ran blithely up the
stairs. Later, when she heard Mrs. Severs in
the room beneath, she went to the head of
the inner stairway and called down to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come up a minute. I want to see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Severs lost no time. &#8220;My husband
says it is simply absurd,&#8221; she began breathlessly.
&#8220;He says people have to do their
duty. He says a thing is right or wrong,
and that settles it. We are all father has in
the world, and Dody says it is plainly our
duty to keep him with us. He says a fellow
would be taking an awful chance to marry
you, if that is a sample of your principles.
Don&#8217;t you believe in any duty, Miss Ainsworth?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Only one,&#8221; said Eveley with great firmness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, what is that?&#8221; came the eager query.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That,&#8221; was the dignified reply, &#8220;is something
that doesn&#8217;t enter into this case at all,
and doesn&#8217;t need to be discussed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Dody says&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Dody may be a very sweet husband, but
he is not progressive. His idea is old, outworn
and antedeluvian. Simply musty.
Now, this is my plan&mdash;the plan of progress
according to new ideas which means happiness
for all. Father-in-law and the whiskered
friend are born for each other. They
are affinities, and soul-mates, and everything.
I saw it at the first glance. We&#8217;ll
get them a little cottage off somewhere beyond
the odor of onions, and they can revel
in liver and pipes to their hearts&#8217; content.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Impossible! Whiskers has a wife of his
own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Eveley was much disconcerted.
&#8220;Well, maybe she will get a divorce so her
husband can marry your father&mdash;I mean&mdash;maybe
it won&#8217;t stick, you know.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been sticking for forty years, and I
suppose it will go on forever. You see she
doesn&#8217;t have him around much and so she
probably forgets how he is. He is always
out with father, and she is asleep when he
gets home.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t worry about it. He had no
business being married, for it was a lovely
plan&mdash;but it can&#8217;t be helped now. Never
mind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; said Mrs. Severs suddenly.
&#8220;Hear the sizzling. That&#8217;s onions. Didn&#8217;t I
tell you? I was going to have chicken croquettes
and creamed peas, with lettuce salad
and fruit jello. But how can Dody and I sit
down to a decent meal with the whole house
reeking with tobacco and onions?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind, dear. We&#8217;ll find the adjustment
in time. Just try to be patient.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For another night, and another day,
Eveley puzzled and pondered&mdash;during intervals
of studying motor folders and reading
advertisements. And the next evening she
found Mrs. Severs wringing her hands on
the front porch.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she asked anxiously. &#8220;Did
he kill himself?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No such luck,&#8221; wailed Mrs. Severs. &#8220;He
won&#8217;t sleep in the bedroom because he says
it is too shady under all those vines, and
he has moved himself out into the living-room
on the couch. He says there is no
sense having a house all cluttered up with
rooms anyhow, he doesn&#8217;t believe in it. He
says two rooms are enough for anybody.
You can cook and eat in the kitchen, and sit
and sleep in the other room, and anything
more is just plain tony.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I tell you what,&#8221; suggested Eveley brightly.
&#8220;Be mean to him. Be real snippy and
bossy. Don&#8217;t let him have his own way.
You just fire him right back into the bedroom.
Tell him you are head of this house,
and he&#8217;s got to mind. Then he&#8217;ll be only too
glad to move out and then you&#8217;ll have some
peace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t,&#8221; moaned Mrs. Severs. &#8220;He&#8217;s
really kind of nice if he wasn&#8217;t so awful. I
couldn&#8217;t be mean to Dody&#8217;s father. And
Dody would not let me if I wanted to.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; said Eveley automatically.
&#8220;I am still working. We will try every
different adjustment, and in time we shall
hit the right one. Just keep happy and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep happy,&#8221; wailed Mrs. Severs. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
be sarcastic, Miss Ainsworth, please. I never
expect to be happy again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she went home, and Eveley called
Nolan on the telephone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must come immediately and have
supper with me. And stop on the way and
get a small steak, and ask the drug-store to
deliver a pint of ice-cream at six-thirty
sharp. And you might bring a nice tomato
if you can remember, and I shall have everything
else ready. We won&#8217;t have much to-night,
just steak and salad and ice-cream.
I need professional advice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan never dreamed of refusing an invitation
of any sort whatever from Eveley,
and he started immediately, gathering up the
dinner on his way. As he put his foot on
the lowest step of the rustic stair, Eveley&#8217;s
head thrust itself suddenly from between the
curtains.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is a proper adjustment,&#8221; she said,
in a stern voice. &#8220;Just keep your mind on
that. Painful duty is no duty, and can not
be. There is a right adjustment&mdash;and we
must find it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan continued warily up the rickety
stair, greeting her at the top cordially.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Eveley. My, the coffee smells good.
I am hungry as a bear, too. I saw you out
last night with that sad-eyed Buddy soldier,
and I do not approve of it. I shall deem it my
duty to administer a proper adjustment of his
facial characteristics if he doesn&#8217;t mind his
own business. The ice-cream will be here at
six-thirty sharp. How is Kitty? You have
flour on your ears. Shall I fix the tomatoes?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not bring you here in a social capacity
to discuss personal matters,&#8221; said
Eveley coldly. &#8220;I told you yesterday that my
home is saddened by the grotesque figure of
maladjustment stalking in our midst under
his usual guise of Duty. As I have explained
so many times, there is bound to be a happy
adjustment. But this time I can not figure
it out. Now I call on you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Retainer&#8217;s fee, one hundreds dollars. Payable,
of course, in advance.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, well, it is not strictly legal. Let&#8217;s just
talk it over nicely as dear good friends, and
if you have an idea I can absorb it. Nolan,
Eileen said she saw you at lunch to-day with
a woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eileen? How is Eileen? I haven&#8217;t seen
her for days. Let&#8217;s have a party soon, and
invite Kitty and Eileen and Miriam and me,
and you give us a midnight supper here in
the Cote, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was at the Grant.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I did not see Eileen, but of course I was
busy. Was she alone? We had a nice luncheon&mdash;grilled
pork chops and country gravy.
The gravy was good&mdash;no lumps. It made me
think of yours.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My gravy is not always lumpy,&#8221; she said
with a frown. &#8220;It just happened that way
the last two times because I was called to the
telephone while I was making it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure, that&#8217;s all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He carefully adjusted her chair at the
table, and drew his own close beside it, pulling
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
his plate and silverware half-way around
the table from where Eveley had placed them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You look sweeter than ever, to-night,
Eve. But I hope the gravy is not lumpy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She wore a black dress and white gloves,
and a black hat.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eileen did? Was it a new dress?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, the one with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure enough, I believe she did. A
georgette dress, beaded in front. Quite
pretty. But there was a rip in her glove.
She showed it to me herself. She said she
did it on the car, but it looked like an old
rip to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And after luncheon you went away in her
car, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Her uncle&#8217;s car. Just for a short run
through the park, and then she dropped me
at the office. Quite a pleasant woman. She
was so polite to me, and treated me with such
gentle deference. It was quite a change. It
made me think of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley put down her fork. &#8220;Who was it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bartlett&#8217;s niece from San Francisco. Visiting
here. He had promised to take her for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_107' name='page_107'></a>107</span>
luncheon, but at the last minute Graves came
in and they were busy, so he turned her over
to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not see why you are always the one
to take their nieces and daughters out for
luncheon. This is the fourth time in two
months. I believe you do it on purpose.
Why should they always pick on you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Partly because of my beauty, perhaps,
and my charming manners as well as my
generally winsome demeanor in the presence
of ladies. I suppose Eileen also informed you
that this niece is Mrs. Harmon Delavan, and
has three children in addition to a husband.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nolan, how you do burble along. I
didn&#8217;t bring you here to discuss Bartlett&#8217;s
relatives. Now get down to business. How
can we adjust the honeymooners and the
father-in-law&mdash;though honestly I think he is
great fun myself, and would a whole lot
rather live with him than with Dody. Only
he does not fit in with the honeymoon scheme
of life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Nolan dreamily, &#8220;why don&#8217;t
you marry him, and bring him up here?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nolan, you are clever. I never
thought of that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the evident delight in her voice, Nolan
stared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to me, goosey, he would never consent,
for I have a dimple and he does not approve
of them. So far I have kept it on the
off side, and he has not noticed, but I
couldn&#8217;t always turn the left side to a husband,
could I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, then&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marry him to somebody else, of course.
I can&#8217;t just decide who&mdash;but there will be
some one. You are such a help, Nolan. Now
let&#8217;s not bother with the duties of our neighbors,
but have a good time. To-morrow I
shall find him a wife.&#8221; Then she leaned toward
Nolan, refilling his cup, and said
gurglingly, &#8220;Was he working awfully hard
at the stupid old office?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eveley, just one thing, while we are on
our duties,&#8221; he said, catching her hand.
&#8220;You have made one exception, always, but
you have never told me what it is. And it is
so unlike you to except anything when you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
get started. What is the one duty that is
justified and necessary?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley promptly pulled her hand away.
&#8220;That,&#8221; she said, &#8220;is purely personal. It
will not do any one any good to talk about
it. So it is all sealed up on the inside.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I shall never know what your one
duty in life is?&#8221; he asked, with mock pleading,
but real curiosity.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It may hit you sometime&mdash;harder than
anybody else,&#8221; she said, laughing. &#8220;But in
the meantime let&#8217;s talk of other things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As soon as Mr. Severs had started to work
the next morning, without the tender farewells,
for the presence of Father-in-law
placed an instinctive veto on such demonstrations&mdash;Eveley
kicked briskly on the floor as
a summons, and Mrs. Severs answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eveley?&#8221; she called up to the ceiling.
</p>
<p>And Eveley shouted down to the floor of
her room, &#8220;Come up&mdash;I&#8217;ve got it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At that Mrs. Severs fairly flew up the
stairs.
</p>
<p>Eveley caught her on the landing, and
whirled her around the room in a triumphant
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
dance, stopping at last so abruptly that Mrs.
Severs was almost precipitated to the floor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now listen. I&#8217;ve got it. The proper adjustment,
that will make you all happy and
prove my theory.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes,&#8221; chanted Mrs. Severs ecstatically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must get married.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now don&#8217;t interrupt. Let me finish. Of
course he has no notion of such a thing, but
leave it to me. We shall marry him off before
he knows it. We must find the woman
first. Out at Chula Vista there are a lot of
beautiful elderly ladies in the Home who are
all alone and would be only too glad to have
a cozy home and a&mdash;a&mdash;pleasant husband
and&mdash;all that. So we&#8217;ll go out on Saturday
afternoon and look them over and pick out
a good one. Then I&#8217;ll invite her to visit me
for a week, and you and I will both be busy
so Father-in-law will have to entertain her,
and she&#8217;ll cut out old Whiskers in no time at
all.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley flung out her hands jubilantly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span></p>
<p>Mrs. Severs showed no enthusiasm. &#8220;That
is what I wanted to tell you. He can&#8217;t. He
is already married.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley dropped into a chair. &#8220;Married!&#8221;
she stammered. &#8220;You told me Dody&#8217;s
mother was dead.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is, of course. But what I did not tell
you is this. Three years ago while Dody
was in France, father must have sort of lost
his mind or something, for without a minute&#8217;s
warning, he up and married somebody&mdash;a
woman, of course. When Dody got home
from the war she was not there, and when
he asked about her, father just sort of
laughed and looked sheepish, and said, &#8216;Oh,
she&#8217;s gone on a visit.&#8217; &#8216;Where to?&#8217; Dody
asked. &#8216;Oh, somewhere around,&#8217; said father.
&#8216;Is she coming back?&#8217; asked Dody. &#8216;Holy
Mackinaw, I hope not,&#8217; said father, and that
is the last we ever heard of her. But of
course he is still married.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was a hard blow, but Eveley rallied at
last, though slowly. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; she
said monotonously. &#8220;There is another adjustment.
Just keep happy&mdash;and give me
time.&#8221;
</p>
<hr class='major' />

<a name='VIII_SHE_MEETS_A_DEMONSTRATOR' id='VIII_SHE_MEETS_A_DEMONSTRATOR'></a>
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>SHE MEETS A DEMONSTRATOR</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve simply got to sneak off on
some pretext or another, and meet me
at the Doric agency at three o&#8217;clock for a
demonstration. They say it is perfectly wonderful&mdash;why,
it hardly takes a look of gas to
go a thousand miles, and its tires are literally
cast iron.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This was her summons by telephone. And
Nolan, determined not to desert trusting little
Eveley to the tender mercies of motor sharks,
went to the Middle Member, whose position
he confidently expected one day to possess,
and announced that important business of a
personal nature required his presence that
afternoon. And because Nolan never abused
privileges&mdash;or if he did was never detected in
the act&mdash;and because his firm was composed
of human beings and not the granite machines
common to fiction, Nolan encountered
no difficulty.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span></p>
<p>And Eveley went to her own employer, and
smiling seductively upon him, said vaguely
that some awfully important and unexpected
things had come up, and could she please get
off at three, if she would work particularly
hard in the meantime to make up?
</p>
<p>And because Eveley was very pretty, and
withal very businesslike, and pleasant about
trifles like working after hours and special
grinds and such things, and because her employer
was acutely conscious of her soft
voice and bright eyes, he smiled in return
and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed, Miss Ainsworth, I heard you
phoning about it. Go, by all means, but I do
not think you will like the Doric. The tires
are all right, but the cylinders are under
size, and this causes a constant friction with
the magneto which impairs the efficiency and
makes the car a poor climber and weak on
endurance runs.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That is probably not what he said at all,
but it is what Eveley understood him to say,
and from it she gathered that she might go
at three, but that there was something perfectly
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
terrible about the Doric that made it
impossible for her to buy it, but of course she
could not disappoint the salesman with the
deep blue eyes, and so she would have the
demonstration anyhow.
</p>
<p>From three o&#8217;clock on, the afternoon was
a perfect daze of magnetos and batteries and
gas feeders and real leather upholstery. But
Eveley interrupted once, to run into a drug-store
to the public telephone, to call Kitty,
and when she had her friend on the wire she
said eagerly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Kit, we are trying out the Doric. It
is awfully good some ways, and rotten some
ways, and so of course I can&#8217;t buy it, but the
salesman has the most irresistible eyes you
ever saw in your life, and so I am wearing my
new blue veil, and I look a dream in it. Now
you scoot up to the Cote, will you, and have
supper ready for us at six&mdash;Nolan and me.
If Nolan were not along I might bring the
blue-eyed Doric man, but he is so overbearing
about those things&mdash;Nolan, I mean. Get a
nice juicy steak, he needs nourishment. I
think if I could feed him constantly for a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span>
month and save him from the restaurants he
might develop enough animal magnetism to&mdash;anyhow,
he needs the steak, so get a good
one at Hardy&#8217;s and charge it to me. And
will you go by the cleaners, and get my motor
gloves&mdash;they said it would only be a quarter
for the cleaning, so don&#8217;t pay them a cent
more. Will you? That&#8217;s a nice girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At six o&#8217;clock, wearily, happily, still discoursing
earnestly of magnetos and batteries,
Eveley and Nolan climbed the rickety rustic
steps, brightening visibly as the odor of
broiling steak and frying potatoes was
wafted out to them. Nolan went in first,
carefully stepping out of the way before he
reached a hand to assist Eveley, for he knew
that she would fall headlong among the
cushions she kept conveniently placed for
that purpose. &#8220;It is easy enough getting in,
if you take your time,&#8221; she always said defensively
to criticizing friends. &#8220;But I am
usually in a hurry myself, so I keep the
cushions handy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>On this evening, being tired, she remained
on the floor where she had comfortably
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_116' name='page_116'></a>116</span>
landed, and lazily removed her hat and veil,
tossing them lightly into a distant corner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If it wasn&#8217;t for the carburetor rubbing
on the spark plugs,&#8221; she said plaintively, &#8220;I&#8217;d
get the Doric in spite of everything. Did
you ever see such blue eyes in your life,
Nolan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Mason is a better car in every way,&#8221;
he said flatly. &#8220;Strongly built, low hung,
smart-looking, and the engine perfect.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley frowned. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t that like a man?
The Mason! I wish you could have seen him,
Kitty. Fifty years old if he was a day, and
bald, and two double chins. And talked
through his nose. And what do you suppose
he talked about? His wife&mdash;and how she
loves the Mason. What do I care what his
wife thinks about the Mason? I wouldn&#8217;t
have the Mason if he offered me one. I&#8217;ll
bet it is so easy riding that it fairly sprouts
double chins&mdash;on the drivers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are buying a car, Eveley&mdash;not a
driver,&#8221; Nolan explained.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the Doric is rather light in weight,
and very high in price. How I wish you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
could have heard him tell about it, Kitty.
When he said carburetor it was just like
running up a scale of music. And his fingernails
were manicured as nicely as my own.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is dinner ready?&#8221; Nolan interrupted furiously.
&#8220;Come and eat. Great Scott! That
girl would buy a bum car and a costly one, because
the demonstrator has shined his nails.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And, Kitty, he said if we could go to-morrow
evening at five-thirty he would take us
to La Jolla to show us how she climbs the
grades. She will go up on high.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When did he say that?&#8221; interrupted
Nolan. &#8220;I can not go with you to-morrow
night. Don&#8217;t you remember I told you we
had a meeting&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know, dear. I am so sorry. But Kitty
will go with us, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will I?&#8221; echoed Kitty ecstatically. &#8220;Won&#8217;t
I? Do you suppose they have another one,
with brown eyes, to go along to&mdash;to change
tires, or anything?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, but we can ask. He is going
to phone me at the office to-morrow to find
out where to call for us. He is very respectable.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
He goes to the Methodist Church, and
his uncle is a banker in Philadelphia.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pass the potatoes, for heaven&#8217;s sake,&#8221;
urged Nolan. &#8220;I feel sick.&#8221; And after a
while he went on, persuasively: &#8220;There is
no use to try that car out again, Eveley. It
is no good. Or if you insist on it put it off
until the next night, and I will go with you.
We&#8217;ll all three go. Make a foursome if you
like, with Kitty and the blue-eyed mutt.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Kitty does not like blue eyes. And besides,
I am the one to be demonstrated to.
And besides,&#8221; she winked at Kitty drolly,
&#8220;I am sure he will be busy the rest of the
week. For when I mentioned that you had
an appointment to-morrow he said most
particularly that to-morrow was the only free
evening he had for weeks to come. And that
reminds me, Nolan, that your advice about
Father-in-law was no good. He is married
already, and it is your fault, getting me
buoyed up with hope, all to no purpose.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan was properly regretful.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think the old man likes to live
with them?&#8221; he asked.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, of course not. He hates it. He almost
shudders when I tell him how lovely
it is to have a son and daughter to live with.
But I suppose he thinks it is his duty to
stick, just as they think it is theirs to make
him stick. People are so absurd, aren&#8217;t
they?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, very,&#8221; he said soberly, his eyes intent
on Eveley&#8217;s hair curling so tenderly
about her ears. And he was really thinking
how very absurd it was that a rising young
lawyer should find it so tempting to touch
that bit of curl, and to kiss it. Very absurd
indeed!
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you thinking of something?&#8221; she
asked hopefully, looking into his earnest
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed.&#8221; And he forced his eyes
away from the distracting curls. &#8220;Yes, indeed
I am.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she begged, leaning toward
him and slipping her fingers with childish
eagerness into his hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why&mdash;just tempt him,&#8221; he stammered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tempt him, Nolan. &#8216;Holy Mackinaw,&#8217; as
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
Father-in-law says, what do you mean, tempt
him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>In this predicament, Nolan was forced to
concentrate. Why in the world had he said,
&#8220;Tempt him?&#8221; The temptation of Eveley had
nothing whatever to do with father-in-laws
and the adjustment of duty. But Eveley expected
him to produce a tangible and reasonable
explanation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, just tempt him, Eveley. You know
what temptation is, don&#8217;t you? Then do it.&#8221;
This was merely playing for time, seeking
for illumination. &#8220;Just&mdash;keep it always before
him, you know&mdash;how nice it would be
to get off alone and be independent.&#8221; Nolan
was a lawyer, and having forced a foothold,
he made it secure. &#8220;Tempt him with freedom,
talk to him about the joys of privacy,
unrestrained intercourse with his whiskered
crony, the delights of unlimited liver and
onions, a bed in the sitting-room, meals by
the kitchen fire, and a jar of tobacco on every
chair. See? Tempt him until he can&#8217;t stand
it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley looked at him appraisingly. &#8220;Nolan
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_121' name='page_121'></a>121</span>
Inglish, you are a whole lot cleverer than I
ever thought you were. That is real talent.
You have found the adjustment this time. I
feel it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan, intoxicated with the warmth of her
voice, the subtle flattery of word and tone,
rushed on.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s find him a house, just a bit of a
shack with a little garden and a mangy dog,
and then razzle him with the vision of independence,
and show him the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Eveley stood up. &#8220;Will you help me
do this, Nolan? You get nicer every day of
your life.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Nolan, except for the presence of
Kitty, would surely have said what he had
no earthly business to say to Eveley yet&mdash;until
circumstances and the Senior Member
made it justifiable.
</p>
<p>He sat glowering and grim at the Important
Meeting the next evening, when he
should have been gratified that his presence
was desired&mdash;for Maley wasn&#8217;t there, nor
Garland, nor Alverson. But in spite of the
Honor, and the Significance, Nolan&#8217;s mind
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span>
was wandering. He lost sight of the Truly
Greats, and saw only a cloudy picture of
Eveley, soft, sweet and dimply, sitting rapt
by the side of the Darned Blue Eyes. And
that night, at eleven o&#8217;clock, on his way to
his modest room, he suddenly started. Coming
demurely out of the Grant, he saw Eveley
and the blue-eyed one, and laughing beside
them, Kitty and some other equally reprehensible
being. Nolan could hardly believe
the evidence of his own eyes.
</p>
<p>He fumed openly while he allowed them a
decent interval for reaching home, and then
called Eveley by telephone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eveley, I thought I saw you and Kitty
coming out of the Grant with some men a
little while ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, did you?&#8221; Eveley&#8217;s voice was vibrant
with surprise.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that funny?&#8221; she laughed a little,
softly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, were you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were we what?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Were you there?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Why, yes, of course. We stopped for a
sandwich. We missed our dinner. The engine
broke down on the Biological Grade,
and held us up for quite a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eveley&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, it was perfectly all right. He found
out to-day that he had a friend who is a
life-long friend of Kitty&#8217;s and he brought him
along, and we were all nicely introduced and
everything was as proper as you please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you buy the car?&#8221; he asked witheringly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, he advised me, confidentially, not
to. He is going to change to the Bemis
agency to-morrow, and he thinks he will find
it much more satisfactory. Wasn&#8217;t it a lovely
night? Did you have a nice time with the
High and Mighties? Kitty is going to stay
all night with me, and we are just making
some hot chocolate. Won&#8217;t you come for a
cup?&mdash;Oh, just Kitty and I, and it is quite
early. Come along, and we&#8217;ll tell you all the
bad points about the Doric. But they say the
Bemis is a wonder.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>ADMITTING DEFEAT</h3>
</div>

<p>The first Saturday after the organization
of the Irish-American League brought a
blessed spring rain, especially heaven-sent on
her account, Eveley felt quite sure, for she
was greatly worn from coping with motor
salesmen and the father-in-law situation.
And this was a rain that not even boys could
stand, so she had a blissful afternoon alone,
purring and puttering about contentedly in
her Cloud Cote.
</p>
<p>But on the second Saturday, according to
agreement, the League met in the appointed
field for a game. This was Eveley&#8217;s first opportunity
to witness the development of
American principles in her chosen flotsam.
The meeting had been called for one-thirty,
and although Eveley arrived fifteen minutes
early she found the field occupied by fully
twenty youths of varying sizes, colors and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
brogues. She gazed upon the motley array
in helpless horror.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ern Swanson is going to be the captain,&#8221;
said John Hop, with his ingratiating Oriental
smile. &#8220;We just had an election and elected
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we already have a captain,&#8221; protested
Eveley, looking not without sympathy to the
corner where Ivan Kerensky nursed his humiliation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We didn&#8217;t know Ern was coming in,&#8221; said
Alfredo Masseno, who had hurried up with
half a dozen others to greet her. &#8220;Ern, he
ought to be the captain. He&#8217;s awful rough;
and baseball, why, he eats baseball alive! And
he won&#8217;t come in unless he is the captain,
and if he don&#8217;t come with us he&#8217;ll join the
Red Dogs on National Avenue, and we want
him with us because we have challenged them
to a game and if they get Ern they&#8217;ll lick
us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then the newly elected captain sauntered
up, his good-natured face reflecting the glory
of his new command as well as his natural
Swedish temperament.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He doesn&#8217;t look rough,&#8221; said Eveley critically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m, not when things suits him, but you
ought to see him when he is mad. Golly!
Why, even the cops lets that kid alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it isn&#8217;t parliamentary&mdash;I mean, it
isn&#8217;t proper to have one election after another
like this. We chose one captain, and
we ought to stand by him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t no quorum what elected him,
ma&#8217;m,&#8221; said Ern Swanson, smiling broadly.
&#8220;They was only eight in the club then, and
now we got twenty-three. That little bunch
o&#8217; Greasers couldn&#8217;t represent us. No, ma&#8217;m.
We want regular Americans at the head of
this club, and so we had a regular election.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley knew this was dead against American
principles, and she looked once more toward
the sulking ex-captain. Then she remembered
that he had won his own election
in her absence by plain coercion, and decided
to pass this one irregularity, but never
again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Very well, then,&#8221; she said weakly, &#8220;have
it your own way this time. But there must
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
be no more elections until the right time.
Now, what are you going to do? Have a
practise game? Then suppose we let Ivan be
captain of the second team, anyhow, and you
can pick your men and have a good game.&#8221;
</p>
<p>This seemed a simple proposition to Eveley
in her innocence, but on a sudden, pandemonium
reigned. The whole crowd of boys
propelled itself violently into the air, and
there was a shrieking of voices and a tossing
of bats and gloves, and a seemingly endless
number of arms flying about. From out the
clamor Eveley could distinguish repeated
hoarse roars of &#8220;Pi-i-i-i-tcher,&#8221; &#8220;Pi-i-i-i-tcher,&#8221;
&#8220;Ca-a-a-a-a-atcher,&#8221; &#8220;Ca-a-a-a-atcher,&#8221;
and she retired to a remote spot to await the
proper moment for gathering up the remains.
Being a lady, she could make no sense
at all of the deadly uproar, and she was
quite thrilled and charmed when of a sudden
the tumult subsided, and she found that out
of that apparently aimless clamor, two teams
had been selected and the players assigned to
their various positions on the field. It was
black magic to her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span></p>
<p>Eveley thought she knew baseball. She
knew what a &#8220;foul&#8221; was, and she knew what
happened when one passed four balls, and she
knew when one was out. And she had often
said fatuously that she loved baseball, because
she understood it. But she did not understand
it. She understood a mild respectable
game that was played by scholarly young
men in college. Baseball as played by the
wild creatures on that Saturday afternoon
was a sealed book to her. And she devoutly
hoped and prayed it would remain sealed.
She felt that death would be preferable to a
full working knowledge of what went on in
the Irish-American Club that afternoon.
</p>
<p>For an interval of perhaps three minutes
the thing progressed with some degree of
reason. Then issued a sudden roar from a
dozen throats, every one came tearing in
from his proper location on the field, and
there was a yelling, huddled group in the
center. Then Eveley crept timidly from the
corner where she was engaging in prayer for
the safety of herself and her club, and advanced
cautiously toward the swaying pile
of shrieking boys.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></p>
<p>She placed soft entreating hands on the
outside layer, she even jumped up and
down and yelled &#8220;Boys,&#8221; at the top of her
healthy voice. But she was only an atom in
a world gone upside down. Presently, however,
and from no reason she could determine,
the mob disentangled itself into distinct entities,
the roar subsided into a few threatening
growls and murmurs, and Captain Swanson
hitched up his trousers and yelled &#8220;Play
ball&#8221; triumphantly. Then the game went on.
This identical thing occurred at intervals of
about eight minutes during the entire afternoon.
</p>
<p>Eveley hoped devoutly that she was by her
very presence helping to Americanize these
particular bits of flotsam and jetsam&mdash;she
trusted so. She was quite confident that so
much personal agonizing on her part ought
to be doing something to the wild beings.
But there was no apparent development.
</p>
<p>She stood her ground bravely until four
o&#8217;clock, and then, thanks to the merciful
Providence who protects the fools gone in
where angels would not dare, it seemed the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span>
whole club had to set about delivering papers.
But as there were important details to be
attended to, such details as arranging for a
permanent place to play, and providing protection
for the balls and bats bought from
Eveley&#8217;s inheritance, and paying dues, it was
decided to have a meeting in the Service Hall
that evening at seven.
</p>
<p>Eveley went home, and to bed.
</p>
<p>At six-thirty she got up, made a percolator
full of strong coffee and drank it all.
</p>
<p>Then she went to the Service Hall to meet
the Irish-American Bloodhounds, as she irreverently
called them in her inner heart.
</p>
<p>Eveley was out of her element, and she
knew it.
</p>
<p>She was bent on Americanization, but not
this kind. She would be glad to assist in the
development of quick and kind-eyed Angelo
at the office, or the courteous Jap in the tea
garden, but for a baseball club she had no
talent. She explained her needs and her deficiencies
to the manager of the Recreation
Center, and he finally agreed that the Bloodhounds
needed a young virile athlete as their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
director. &#8220;And for his own sake,&#8221; said
Eveley almost tearfully, &#8220;he ought to be a
pugilist. I say this for his good. We
need all our assimilators and should not expose
them to sudden and violent death.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Eveley talked to the boys, and told
them how she had enjoyed and liked them,
but explained that being only a woman she
was terribly handicapped, and so would
leave them to the discretion of one yet to be
selected. She hoped they would remember
they were good Americans, that they stood
for honor and loyalty and right. Then she
thanked God she was free, took her coat and
hat and went out.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Miss Ainsworth! Is it really you?
What in the world are you doing here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley, startled on the threshold of the
Service Club, looked up into the face of the
blue-eyed Bemis salesman.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Mr. Hiltze,&#8221; she said mysteriously.
&#8220;It is a deadly secret. You must never
breathe a word of it. But since you have
caught me in the act, I may as well confess.
I am an Americanizer.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Great Scott!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You know what that is, don&#8217;t you? Helping
to sort out and assimilate the flotsam
and jetsam of the foreign element, and imbue
it with sturdy American principles, and all
that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Hiltze laughed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps you do not understand the new
great movement of Americanization,&#8221; she
said with dignity. &#8220;It is the one immense
fine movement of the day. It is to effect the
amalgamation of all the riff-raff of humanity
into a new America.&#8221; Eveley did not mention
the quotation marks which circled her
words.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is wonderful,&#8221; he said warmly. &#8220;It
is a great surprise and a great pleasure, to
find women of your type taking an interest
in this progressive movement.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley leaned excitedly toward him. &#8220;Oh,
Mr. Hiltze, are you interested in it, too?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;None more so, though like yourself I feel
the best work is done silently and unobtrusively,
and I prefer not to be exploited from
the housetops.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, this gives me courage again&mdash;and I
had nearly lost it. Have you been working
to-night? Are you through for the evening?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, and if your labors have been as exhaustive
and soul-wracking as mine, perhaps
you can spare an hour for nourishment with
me at the Grant. Of all the jobs in the world!
Selling motors is a game beside it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We agree again. I think it was rather
foolish of me to tackle it in the beginning.
I haven&#8217;t brains enough. Those boys may be
flotsam and jetsam and all that, but they
know more about patriotism than I do. Why,
one little Italian, the cutest thing, with
dimples and curly hair, told me more about
country-love than I could have thought up
in a month. He says, isn&#8217;t it patriotic
for them to come here and pick up all the
good they can, and take it back to enrich
their own country? And when you come
right down to it, isn&#8217;t it? Anyhow, the little
Italians and Mexicans and Jews and I have
organized an Irish-American Baseball Team,
and I suppose we are amalgamating something
into something. I think they are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span>
amalgamating me. I feel terribly amalgamated
right now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not in sympathy with the club idea,&#8221;
said Hiltze thoughtfully, as they turned down
Broadway toward the Grant. &#8220;It is such a
treat to find your kind of woman in this&mdash;I
mean, the womanly kind&mdash;I abhor the high-brow
women that are so full of forward movement
they can&#8217;t settle down to pal around
comfortably and be human.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley, too, was kindling with the charm
of a common interest and enthusiasm. Nolan
took a very masculine stand on the subject.
He said bruskly that the growth of Americanization
must come from Americans. He
said you couldn&#8217;t cram American ideals into
the foreign-born until the home-born lived
them. And he said the way to &#8220;teach Americanization
was by being a darned good American
yourself inside and outside and all the
way through.&#8221; Which may have been good
sense, but was no help in the forward movement.
</p>
<p>So Eveley looked upon Mr. Hiltze with
great friendliness and sympathy, though she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_135' name='page_135'></a>135</span>
did glance up at the National Building as
they went by, noticing the light in Nolan&#8217;s
window, wondering if he was working hard&mdash;and
if the work necessitated the presence
of the new, good-looking stenographer the
firm had lately acquired.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, my idea of Americanization,&#8221; Mr.
Hiltze was saying when she finally tore her
thoughts away from the National Building,
&#8220;is pure personal effort. You take a club,
and mix a lot of nationalities, and types, and
interests up together&mdash;they work upon one
another, and work upon you, and you get
nowhere. But take an individual. Get chummy
with him. Be with him. Study him.
Make him like you&mdash;interest him in your
work, and your sport, and your life&mdash;and
there you have an American pretty soon.
Club work is not definite, not decisive. It
is the personal touch that counts. You could
fritter away hours with a baseball club, and
end at last just where you began. But you
put the same time into definite personal contact
with one individual foreigner&mdash;a girl, of
course it would be in your case&mdash;it is young
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
men in mine. You take a girl&mdash;a foreigner&mdash;win
her confidence, then her interest, then
her love&mdash;and you&#8217;ve made an American.
That is the only Americanization that will
stick. Suppose in a whole year you have won
only one&mdash;still see what you have done. That
one will go out among her friends, her relatives,
she will marry and have children&mdash;and
your Americanization is sown and re-sown,
and goes on multiplying itself&mdash;yes, forever.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are right,&#8221; said Eveley. &#8220;And you
find me a girl, and I will do it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a bargain,&#8221; he said quickly, stopping
in the street to grasp her hand. &#8220;You are a
little thoroughbred, aren&#8217;t you? It may take
time, but as I go about among the young
men I work with&mdash;well, I am pretty sure to
find a girl among them.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>THE ORIGINAL FIXER</h3>
</div>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Nolan,&#8221; came Eveley&#8217;s voice over
the telephone, in its most wheedling
accent, &#8220;I am so sorry to spoil our little party
for to-night, but it is absolutely necessary
just this once. The most utterly absurd case
of painful duty you ever heard of. And although
you do not exactly approve of my
campaign, you would simply have to agree
with me this time. And&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since I can&#8217;t help it, I can stand it,&#8221;
he said patiently. &#8220;What is it this time?
Some silly woman finding it her duty to house
and home all straying and wounded cats, or
a young girl determined to devote her life to
the salvation of blue-eyed plumbers, or&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a man,&#8221; she interrupted, rather
acidly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Ah,&#8221; came in guarded accents.
</p>
<p>There was silence for a tune.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span></p>
<p>&#8220;A man,&#8221; he repeated encouragingly,
though not at all approvingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. A long time ago he very carelessly
engaged himself to a giddy little butterfly in
Salt Lake City, and he doesn&#8217;t want to marry
her at all, but he feels it is his duty because
they have been engaged for so many years.
Isn&#8217;t it pitiful?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But it is none of your business,&#8221; he began
sternly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is another engagement with the enemy
in my campaign,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;Oh, just
think of it&mdash;the insult to love, the profanation
of the sacrament of marriage&mdash;the&mdash;the&mdash;the
insult to womanhood&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You said insult before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but just think of it. I feel it is my
duty to save him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you come across him?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the new member of our firm. I told
you about him long ago. The good-looking
one. He has been with us six months, but I
am just getting acquainted with him. We
had luncheon together to-day, and he told
me about it. He doesn&#8217;t like social butterflies
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
at all, he likes clever, practical girls,
with high ideals, and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Like you, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. I explained my theory to
him, and he was perfectly enchanted with it.
But he could not quite grasp it all in those
few minutes&mdash;it is rather deep, you know&mdash;and
so he is coming up to dinner to-night to
make a thorough study of it. He feels it is
his one last hope, and if it fails him, he is
lost in the sea of a loveless marriage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not object to your fishing him out
of the loveless sea,&#8221; Nolan said plaintively.
&#8220;But I do object to his eating the steak you
promised me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of the cause,&#8221; she begged. &#8220;Think
of the glory of winning another duty-bound
soul to the boundless principles of freedom.
Think of&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t think of anything, Eveley,&#8221; he said
sadly, &#8220;except that good-looking fellow eating
my steak, cooked by the hands of my er&mdash;girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, he took it very seriously.
For while he was still firmly wedded
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
to his ideal of fame and fortune, he was unceasingly
haunted by the fearful nightmare
of some interloper &#8220;beating his time,&#8221; as he
crudely but patently expressed it.
</p>
<p>He spent a long and dreary evening, followed
by other evenings equally long and
dreary, for the Good-Looking Young Member
found great difficulty in mastering the intricacies
of a Dutiless Life, and Eveley continued
his education with the greatest patience,
and some degree of pleasure.
</p>
<p>Her interest in the pursuit of motors did
not wane, however, and after trying every
known make of car, and investigating the
advance reports of all cars designed for manufacture
in the early future, she blithely invested
her fortune in a sturdy blue Rollsmobile,
and was immediately enraptured with
the sensation of absolute control of a throbbing
engine.
</p>
<p>She found it no trifling matter to attend to
her regular duties as private secretary, to
keep her Cloud Cote dainty and sweet as of
yore, to be out in her little blue car on every
possible occasion, and still not neglect the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
Good-Looking Member and the Father-in-law
in her campaign against duty.
</p>
<p>First of all, she invited the elder Mr. Severs
to dinner, and forestalled his refusal by saying:
&#8220;Please. I have a perfectly wonderful
calf&#8217;s liver, and I want you to cook it for
me. The odor that comes up from the
kitchen below is irresistible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>No father-in-law who loved calf&#8217;s liver and
a kitchen could withstand that invitation and
he found he had accepted before he knew it.
To his boundless delight, the dinner was as
though designed in Heaven, for his delectation.
Clam chowder, calves&#8217; liver and sliced
onions, watermelon preserves, and home
made apple pie&mdash;made by Kitty, who had received
rigid orders to provide the richest and
juiciest confection possible, overflowing with
apples and spice.
</p>
<p>As they sat chummily together over a red
table-cloth, which Eveley had bought especially
for this occasion, she said thoughtfully:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe I am the only really happy person
in the world. Do you know why? It is
because I am free. I am not dependent on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
the whims or fancies of any one. I eat what
I like, go where I like, sleep when I like. It
is the only life. I often think how remarkable
it is that you can be so happy living
down there with those honeymooners, doing
everything to please them, eating what they
like, going to bed when they get sleepy. It
is wonderfully unselfish of you&mdash;but I
couldn&#8217;t. I have to be free.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are a sensible girl,&#8221; he said thoughtfully.
&#8220;I never saw any one more sensible.
Don&#8217;t you ever get married. You stay like
you are. Holy Mackinaw! Don&#8217;t this liver
melt in your mouth?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not really care for an apartment like
this,&#8221; Eveley went on. &#8220;I prefer a cottage,
off by itself, with a little garden, and a
few chickens in the back yard, just a tiny
shack in a eucalyptus grove, a couple of
rooms where I can eat in the kitchen and
sleep in the living-room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mama, it sounds like Heaven,&#8221; and
he rolled his eyes to the ceiling.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am looking for a cottage now. If I find
exactly what I want, I may move. I should
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
think you would prefer something like that
yourself&mdash;a little rusty cot and a garden and
a dog, where you could smoke all over the
house, and have your friend come in for
pinochle every night. I do not see how you
can live as you do cooped up with a bride
and groom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sighed dolorously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I suppose some people like it. It
wouldn&#8217;t do for me. That is why I am looking
for a cottage. Do you drive a car?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;A Ford. I wanted to buy a Ford, but
daughter said no, they would not have a
Ford. They would wait till they could afford
an electric. She wouldn&#8217;t let me buy a Ford
for myself either. Said it looked too poor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever have one?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Me? Sure I did. But I accidentally
drove off the road into the sand when I was
fishing once, and the tide was coming in and
it washed the car down. And when I got
back with another car to tow mine out, it was
gone. Some said the tide carried it out to
sea, and some said a thief stole it, but it was
gone, so it didn&#8217;t matter how it went.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></p>
<p>Then Eveley was content to talk of other
things.
</p>
<p>The next day she called up from the office,
and asked to speak to Father-in-law.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going up to see a little cottage to-night,&#8221;
she said excitedly. &#8220;And my car is
in the garage for adjustment. I unfortunately
hit a curb and banged my fender. So I
have rented a Ford for an hour or so, and
want you to come along and drive it for me.
Will you? Good! I will be there at five
o&#8217;clock.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is a sensible girl,&#8221; he said to his son&#8217;s
wife as he hung up the receiver. &#8220;A nice
sensible girl. She ought to help you a good
lot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mrs. Severs only sniffed. She knew this
was the working out of Eveley&#8217;s plot, though
Eveley had not confided in her, knowing instinctively
that the bride would tell the
groom, and that the groom would be sure to
stop it. So Mrs. Severs saw her father-in-law
clamber into the little car at five
o&#8217;clock, with something like hope in her
breast.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_145' name='page_145'></a>145</span></p>
<p>For a time, he was intensely absorbed in
the manipulation of the gears, and the
brakes, his lower lip clutched tightly between
his teeth, breathing in full short gusts like
a war horse champing for battle. But when
at last they were fully started and running
with reasonable smoothness, he said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says this isn&#8217;t a car? You talk to
daughter about it, will you? You explain to
her that this is a regular car like anything
else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some people are so funny, aren&#8217;t they?
How well you drive it! It is lots of sport,
isn&#8217;t it? I should think it would be fine for
you to have a car to run around in. Then
you and your friend could go to Ocean Beach,
and fish, and up to the mountains and shoot,
and have a wonderful time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hadn&#8217;t thought of that. I&mdash;you talk to
daughter, will you? Tell her she won&#8217;t have
to ride in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Turn to the right here,&#8221; said Eveley suddenly.
&#8220;The cottage is the cunningest thing
you ever saw, just two rooms, high on the
hill overlooking the bay. I am so tired of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
being cooped up in a house with a whole
crowd. I want to be absolutely free to do as
I please.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He sighed heavily again. &#8220;It is the only
life. The only way to live. But shucks,
folks can&#8217;t always have what they want.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There it is, that little white house, third
from the corner,&#8221; she said, pointing eagerly,
as he drew up the car to a spasmodic halt.
</p>
<p>He looked critically at the small lawn and
the tiny cottage. &#8220;Those rose-bushes need
trimming,&#8221; he said, frowning. &#8220;There&#8217;s a
loose corner on the porch, too. Bet that grass
hasn&#8217;t been watered for three weeks. Why
folks don&#8217;t keep up their property is more
than I can see.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at the view,&#8221; said Eveley suddenly.
&#8220;See the ships out in the bay, and the aeroplanes
over North Island. Isn&#8217;t it beautiful?
If we had field-glasses we could see the people
walking around in Tent City, and the lemon
in the tea on the veranda at Coronado.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got field-glasses at home,&#8221; he said
wistfully. &#8220;In my suit-case. But I didn&#8217;t
unpack. Daughter does not like a lot of trash
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span>
around the house. I&#8217;ll bet we could see the
gobs on that battle-ship if we had the
glasses.&#8221; He turned again to the yard. &#8220;It&#8217;ll
take a lot of work keeping up this place. And
you busy every day wouldn&#8217;t have much time
for it. I reckon you&#8217;d be afraid alone nights,
too. An apartment is better for a woman by
herself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But the freedom&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Women hadn&#8217;t ought to have too much
freedom. It spoils &#8217;em. This is the born
place for a man&mdash;and a dog&mdash;and field-glasses&mdash;and
a Ford.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go inside and look it over,&#8221; said
Eveley. &#8220;Did you ever see such a place for
chickens? Nice clean little coops all ready
for them. Wouldn&#8217;t it be a paradise for half
a dozen hens?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lot of work raising chickens,&#8221; said
the old man. &#8220;It&#8217;s a job for a man, really.
You wouldn&#8217;t like it.&#8221; Then, thoughtfully:
&#8220;Half a day&#8217;s work would make that place fit
for the king&#8217;s pullets.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And look at the cunning little garden,&#8221;
urged Eveley.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Needs hoeing. All run over with weeds.
Whole place going to rack and ruin. Needs
a man around here, anybody can see that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come in, come in,&#8221; cried Eveley, unlocking
the kitchen door. &#8220;See the little gas stove,
and the tiny table&mdash;and the cooler. Isn&#8217;t it
fun? Couldn&#8217;t you have the time of your
life here, reveling in liver and cabbage and
pinochle? Wouldn&#8217;t your friend be crazy
about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>The old man squirmed restlessly, and
passed into the next room. Eveley dropped
down on the side of the bed, and set the
springs bounding.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a good bed. That table seems made
for pinochle, doesn&#8217;t it? I can just see this
place, with you and your friend, the room
thick with smoke&mdash;and no one to say, &#8216;Oh,
father, it&#8217;s terribly late.&#8217;&#8221; Eveley put up a
very fair imitation of Mrs. Severs&#8217; ripply,
bridal voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A phonograph&mdash;there ought to be a phonograph,
to play <i>Bonnie Sweet Bessie</i>, and
<i>Nelly Gray</i>.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just the thing. A phonograph. That is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
the one thing lacking. I knew there was
something needed.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Father-in-law was quiet after that. He
walked about slowly, peering into every nook
and corner. But finally he went out to the
car, and climbed in. Eveley followed silently.
He started the car with a bang and a tug,
and drove home swiftly, speaking not one
word on the way. But Eveley was content.
</p>
<p>Quite late that evening he came up the
rustic stairs and knocked on her window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Miss Ainsworth,&#8221; he asked anxiously,
&#8220;did you decide to take that cottage and
live alone? Pretty risky business, I&#8217;m afraid.
And it&#8217;s a sight of work keeping up a garden
like that&mdash;and chickens are a dickens of a lot
of trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid so,&#8221; said Eveley wistfully.
&#8220;I believe your advice is good. It is a darling
little place, but I suspect I&#8217;d better give up
the idea entirely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. You&#8217;re a sensible girl. Very
sensible.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And he turned abruptly and went creaking
down the stairs once more.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span></p>
<p>The next evening as she swung her car up
to the curb, Eveley found him waiting.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ll have to give it up,&#8221; he said,
and added apologetically, &#8220;I thought since
you didn&#8217;t want it, I might take it myself.
But if I went away they&#8217;d think I was dissatisfied,
and maybe they hadn&#8217;t been good
to me or something. I wouldn&#8217;t like to hurt
their feelings.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you pretend you hate to leave,
but you feel it is your duty?&#8221; Eveley
almost choked on the word, but she knew it
would be only folly to explain her advanced
ideas to this kindly conscientious soul. &#8220;You
tell them that you think it is your solemn
duty to go and leave them alone, and that
you can&#8217;t be happy unless you are doing
your duty. Tell them that honeymooners
need to be alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good idea. I&#8217;ll try it on them
right away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When he timidly, then enthusiastically
pressed his case, Mrs. Severs, seeing in his
sudden determination to do his duty the
happy fruition of Eveley&#8217;s plan, voiced only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
a few polite words of mild protest, but her
husband was flat-footed and vociferous in his
objections.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just cut out the nonsense, dad, and behave
yourself. It is your duty to stay here
where you belong, and you can stick
around and get used to it. You can&#8217;t go off
by yourself, and that settles it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be lonesome,&#8221; said his father
meekly. &#8220;I could get along. And I could
come and visit you. I think&mdash;maybe&mdash;I&#8217;d
like it pretty good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m on to you, dad. You just say
that because you think it would be better for
us. Why, you&#8217;d be lonely as the deuce.&#8221;
And he went off into the other room and
considered the subject closed.
</p>
<p>Late that night, Mrs. Severs ran up the
stairs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eveley, he really asked to go, but Dody
wouldn&#8217;t hear of it. And I do feel ashamed
of myself. We can&#8217;t turn the poor old fellow
out. It would not be right. Just let it go,
and I&#8217;ll try to get used to it. He really is a
dear old thing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Listen here, Mrs. Severs, do you mean
that you are selfish enough to keep that poor
old man here with you spooners when he
really wants to be off alone where he can fish
and cook and roam around to his heart&#8217;s content?
Can&#8217;t you see it is your plain duty to
make him go where he can live his own life?
I&mdash;I am surprised at you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! You think&mdash;you mean&mdash;maybe he
would be happier?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, of course he would. And it is your
duty to deny yourselves in order to make
him happy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I see.&#8221; Mrs. Severs was quite radiant.
&#8220;Talk to Dody about it, will you? He
wants to do his duty, but he sees it the other
way round.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave him to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Some time later, Father-in-law himself
crept softly up the stairway and tapped on
the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hist,&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;It&#8217;s no good. Andy
won&#8217;t hear of it. Can&#8217;t you think of something?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Leave him to me,&#8221; she said again. &#8220;I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
am the original little fixer, and I&#8217;ll attend to
Andrew Dody.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next morning, quite willing to sacrifice
her last nap in her desire to crush all duty,
she started for work half an hour earlier than
usual, and invited Mr. Severs to ride down-town
with her. And as they started off,
Father and Daughter-in-law from separate
windows of the house watched their departure,
and prayed that success might crown
her efforts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to talk to you confidentially, Mr.
Severs,&#8221; she said softly. &#8220;I&mdash;I think you
misunderstand some things. I have been
with your father such a lot, and I have discovered
that he really wants to live alone.
He likes to be free to do things when he
likes, and how.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He can do that in our home, Miss Ainsworth,&#8221;
Andy said stiffly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course he can, but he thinks he can&#8217;t.
He wants to do as Mrs. Severs likes. He is
only pretending it is his duty to go, because
he thought it would hurt your feelings if <i>you</i>
knew he wanted to leave you. He is just
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
crazy about both of you, but he is so used to
doing every little thing in his own sweet
way. It almost seems your duty fairly to
make him go, because he would be happier.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not one to shirk my duty, Miss Ainsworth.
I will sacrifice anything for my
father.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course it will be lonely for you when
he goes, but think how happy he will be
following his every desire. I should think
you would fairly force him to be selfish
enough to leave you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You may be right. He does not care for
our way of living, I know, and he does like
messing around. And then, too, it upsets
our plans a lot having him there, but whatever
is right for dad, is right for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he must certainly have the little
shack we saw the other day&mdash;he adored it.
You just tell him how lonely you will be, and
how you will miss him, Mr. Severs, and then
make him take the little cottage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Talking it over afterward with Nolan,
Eveley admitted regretfully that she could
hardly call this a victory&mdash;because Father-in-law
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
only moved to do his duty, and the children
only allowed him to go for the sake of
doing theirs&mdash;but since everything worked
out right, she was satisfied, though she alone
knew that happiness came to the three because
each one followed his own desire to the
exclusion of other considerations.

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>THE GERM OF DUTY</h3>
</div>

<p>The case of the Good-Looking Member
strained Nolan&#8217;s patience almost to the
breaking point, but after many days of fruitless
chafing, his forbearance was rewarded.
</p>
<p>Eveley invited him to dinner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you rescued the good-looking one
from the loveless sea?&#8221; he asked sarcastically.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have sown the good seed,&#8221; she said
amiably.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I never heard of sowing seeds in a loveless
sea,&#8221; he sneered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have thought up a wonderful scheme.
But you will have to help me out. I always
fall back on you in an emergency, don&#8217;t I?&#8221;
Eveley&#8217;s voice was sweetest honey. &#8220;So you
must come to dinner.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is the Handsome Member to be among
those present?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Nolan, this is our party&mdash;to talk
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
things over all by ourselves. It seems such
ages since I saw you, and I&#8217;ve been so lonesome.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan was fully aware that this was fabrication,
but being totally male, he found himself
unable to resist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not know what lonesomeness is,
Eveley. I nearly died. I almost wished
I would die. I shall come early, and please
wear the blue dress, and be good to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That evening, after a long and satisfying
preamble, they sat before her tiny grate with
their coffee, and she broached the wonderful
plan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is the most utterly married-to-duty
thing you ever saw. He says he can not in
common decency refuse to marry a girl who
has been engaged to him for five years. He
hasn&#8217;t even seen her for three, and isn&#8217;t a bit
interested in her. Why, they only write
once a month, or so. That&#8217;s no love-affair,
anybody can see that. But he won&#8217;t ask her
to let him off, and so we have thought up the
most scientific scheme to work it. He is inviting
her to come here for a visit, and she
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_158' name='page_158'></a>158</span>
is to stay with me. She hates sensible businesslike
men, and she adores scatter-brain,
fussy ones. So when she comes, he is going
to be as poky as duty itself, and wear old
grimy clothes, and work day and night, and
you are going to don your sunshine apparel
and blossom out like a rose, and beau her
around in great style. Result, she will fire
him, hoping to ensnare you&mdash;but don&#8217;t you
make any mistake and get yourself ensnared
for keeps, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is going to work evenings, is he?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, day times and night times and all
times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And I am to cavalier the lady?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not the lady,&#8221; she denied indignantly.
&#8220;Both of us. You shan&#8217;t go out with her
alone. She is a terrible flirt, and very pretty.
Where you and she goeth, I shall goeth also.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I can stand it. But what is to become
of my own future? Why should I
neglect my legal interests to beau another
fellow&#8217;s sweetheart about the town?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Because you always help me out of a
tight place,&#8221; she said wheedlingly. &#8220;And because
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span>
you do not approve of my campaign.
But if you are nice and help me this time, I
think I can everlastingly prove that I am
right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;If I do the work, seems to me I do the
proving.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but it is my theory, so I get the
credit. Of course you must be very gay and
make quite a fuss over Miss Weldon, but
don&#8217;t you carry it too far, or you&#8217;ll be in
bad with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Anything that meant the eclipse of the
Handsome Member could not be other than
satisfactory to Nolan. He agreed with a
great deal of enthusiasm, only stipulating
that all evenings previous to the arrival of
the pretty fiancée should be devoted to private
rehearsal of his part under the personal
direction of the Dutiless Theorist.
</p>
<p>So it was Nolan and Eveley who met Miss
Weldon at the station upon her arrival. They
stood together beside the white columns,
searching the faces of the passengers as they
alighted. When a slender, fair-haired girl
swung lightly down, they hurried to greet her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Weldon?&#8221; asked Eveley, with her
friendly smile. &#8220;I am Eveley Ainsworth, and
this is my friend, Mr. Inglish. Mr. Baldwin
could not get away to-night&mdash;&#8217;way up to his
ears in work. But he is coming up to see you
later this evening.&#8221;
</p>
<p>If Miss Weldon was disappointed she gave
no sign. Instead she turned to Nolan with
frankly approving eyes, remarking his tall
slim build, his thin clever face, his bright
keen eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you so devoted to business, Mr.
Inglish?&#8221; she asked, as she opened her small
bag and took out a solitaire, which she placed
on the third finger of her left hand. At the
smiles in the eyes of Eveley and Nolan, she
only laughed. &#8220;Why flaunt your badge of
servitude? But don&#8217;t tell Timmy, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>She was indeed very pretty, with warm
shining eyes, and a quick pleasant voice. She
was full of a bright wit, too, and the drive
to Eveley&#8217;s Cote in the Clouds was only
marred for Eveley by the fact that she, being
driver, had to sit in front alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We shall not do much cavaliering in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
car,&#8221; she thought grimly. &#8220;Not when there
are only three of us. We&#8217;ll walk&mdash;three
abreast.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Weldon was enchanted with the rustic
steps, but a little fearful of them as well, and
appropriated Nolan as her personal bodyguard
and support. She squealed prettily at
every creak and rumble.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never try these steps alone, Mr.
Inglish,&#8221; she said, clinging to his not-unwilling
hand. &#8220;I shall always wait for you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll roll her down, if she begins that,&#8221;
thought Eveley.
</p>
<p>But in spite of her disapproval, even to her
there was something very attractive in the
pretty girlish merriment and interest of her
young guest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not see why Nolan had to squeeze in
on this,&#8221; she said to herself most unfairly.
</p>
<p>Miss Weldon was charmed with the dainty
apartment, and loved the cunning electric fixtures
in the tiny dining-room. She tucked
an apron under her belt, and appointed Nolan
her assistant in making toast, while Eveley
finished the light details of serving dinner.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It certainly is a silly business all the way
around,&#8221; Eveley decided.
</p>
<p>After their coffee, and after Nolan had
finished his second cigar, Miss Weldon said,
&#8220;Now since Miss Ainsworth got dinner, we
must do the dishes. I shall wash, and you
must dry them, Mr. Inglish, and be sure you
make them shine, for I am very fussy about
my dishes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Eveley had to sit down in a big chair
and rest, though she did not feel like sitting
down and hated resting&mdash;and look quietly on
while Miss Weldon fished each separate dish
from the hot suds and held it out playfully
for Nolan to wipe. It made a long and laborious
task of the dish washing for Eveley,
and she was quite worn out at its conclusion.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Funny that some people can&#8217;t do their
plain duty without getting the whole neighborhood
mixed up in it,&#8221; she thought resentfully.
</p>
<p>At nine o&#8217;clock, came Timothy Baldwin.
Miss Weldon met him at the window,
looked at him, half curiously, half fearfully,
and after lifting her lips for a fleeting kiss,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
backed quickly away from him into a remote
corner.
</p>
<p>Then Nolan, according to prearranged plan,
suggested that he and Eveley run down and
put the car in the garage. &#8220;And if there is a
moon, we may go for a joy-ride, so don&#8217;t
expect us back too soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And as they rode he spoke so unconcernedly
of Sally&#8217;s smiles and curls and pretty
hands, that Eveley was restored to her original
enthusiasm for the campaign.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t she be wild?&#8221; she chuckled, snuggling
close against Nolan&#8217;s side, but never
forgetting that she was mistress of the
wheel. &#8220;Tim is going to talk business all the
time, and at ten-thirty he is going to say he
must hurry home to rest up for a hard day&#8217;s
work to-morrow. We are not to get in until
eleven, so she will be utterly bored to distraction.
Isn&#8217;t it fun?&#8221;
</p>
<p>They drove slowly, happily around the
park, over the bridge and under the bridge,
around the eucalyptus knoll above the lights
on the bay, and then went down-town for ice-cream.
At exactly eleven o&#8217;clock, Nolan took
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
her hands as she stood on the bottom step of
the rustic stair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say it is your duty to&mdash;be good
to me&mdash;but I hope it will make you happy.
And by the rules of your own game, I have
a right selfishly to insist on your being always
sweet and wonderful to me, and to me
alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just what do you mean by that, Nolan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing, of course, but can&#8217;t you use your
imagination?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t. That is for brides and
fiancées, not for unattached working girls
like me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she ran on up the stairs, and Nolan
went home.
</p>
<p>True to arrangement, Tim had gone at
ten-thirty, and Miss Weldon in a soft negligee
was sitting alone pensively, before the fire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tim has changed,&#8221; she said briefly. &#8220;I
think he has more sense, but a little less&mdash;er&mdash;warmth,
I might say.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think so? He works very hard.
He is fearfully ambitious and they think
everything of him at the office.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes? Then he must certainly have
changed. He was not keen on business at
Salt Lake. He lost three jobs in eight weeks.
That is why he came west. And his father
has financed half a dozen ventures for him.
But perhaps he has settled down, and will do
all right. I love your little apartment, and it
is dear to call it a Cloud Cote, and Mr. Nolan
is perfectly charming. Timmy asked us to
meet him at Rudder&#8217;s for luncheon, you and
me and your Mr. Nolan, also.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, that is nice,&#8221; said Eveley. &#8220;I&#8217;ll come
up for you in the car a few minutes earlier.
You won&#8217;t mind being alone most of the day,
will you? I work, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I rather like being alone. I sew some,
and I shall read, and there are letters to
write. I do not mind being alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley found her really very agreeable,
quite pleasant to entertain. And after all
Nolan had only done as she requested, and
there was nothing personal in it. It was lots
of fun, but it must stop before Miss Weldon
had time to grow really fond of Nolan, for of
course she could not have him under any
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span>
circumstances. Eveley absolutely disbelieved
in any form of duty, still she would not feel
justified in carrying her animosity to the
point of wilfully breaking innocent hearts.
</p>
<p>At twelve-thirty the next day, Eveley and
Miss Weldon entered the small waiting-room
of Rudder&#8217;s café. Nolan was already there.
They waited fifteen minutes for Timothy, and
then a messenger came down to them with a
note. Mr. Baldwin was so sorry, but business
was urgent, and they must go right ahead
and have luncheon without him. He would
telephone them later in the evening if he
could come up.
</p>
<p>Sally Weldon pursed her lips a little, but
she smiled at Nolan. &#8220;Can you beau us both,
Mr. Inglish? We think we are mighty lucky
to have half a beau a piece on working days.
Are you the only man in this whole town
who does not work like a slave?&#8221;
</p>
<p>So they found a pleasant table in the café,
and dawdled long over their luncheon, laughing
and chatting. Then they took Nolan back
to his office, and Eveley and Sally went for a
drive on the beach to La Jolla.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_167' name='page_167'></a>167</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But don&#8217;t you have to work?&#8221; asked Sally,
observing that it was long after two when
they finally turned back toward the office.
</p>
<p>Eveley shrugged her shoulders prettily.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, nobody works much but Mr. Baldwin,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;He does the grinding for
the whole force.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Weldon frowned a little, but said
nothing.
</p>
<p>That evening she had the dinner nicely
started when Eveley reached home, and
Eveley was loud in praise of her guest&#8217;s skill
and cleverness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just lovely, but you must not work.
You are company.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I rather like to cook. I took a long course
in it four years ago when Timmy and I were
first engaged, and I have done all the housekeeping
at home since then. Daddy pays me
double the salary we used to pay the cook,
and I provide better meals and more cheaply
than she did. Daddy says so himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Sally,&#8221; cried Eveley warmly, &#8220;I
think that is wonderful. I am surprised. I
thought&mdash;I supposed&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I know what you thought,&#8221; laughed
Sally brightly. &#8220;Everybody thinks so, and
it is true. I am very gay and frivolous. I
love to dance and sing and play. And I abhor
solemn ugly grimy things, and I think the
only Christian duty in the world is being
happy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley flushed at that, and turned quickly
away.
</p>
<p>Later Nolan joined them for dinner, and
the little party was waxing very gay long
before Tim called. Then it was only to say
that he would be working late, but was sending
them tickets for the theater and would
join them afterward for supper at the Grant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does he always work as hard as this?&#8221;
asked Sally, looking steadily into Eveley&#8217;s
face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He always works pretty hard,&#8221; said
Eveley truthfully, &#8220;but he does seem busier
than usual right now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miss Weldon only laughed, and they talked
of other things. Nolan went down with them
in the car, Eveley driving alone in front, but
somehow she felt her pretty guest to be less
of a menace since she was guilty of sensible
things like cooking and sewing.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-168.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;Just what do you mean by that?&#8221;
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span></div>
<p>Eveley did not explain that Timothy had
felt inclined to join them for dinner and the
show that night after disappointing them at
luncheon, but she had been firm with him.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-day,&#8221; she insisted. &#8220;You can only
have one hour with us to-night. To-morrow
you can join us for luncheon and a short
drive afterward, if you will fix it so I can get
off.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was at the Grant waiting when they
arrived, and rather impatient.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you have a pleasant time?&#8221; he asked,
looking into Sally&#8217;s bright face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lovely. And did you hurry terribly to
meet us? We don&#8217;t want to interfere with
your work, or bother you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>He searched her face for signs of guile, but
her eyes were unclouded, and her manner indicated
only a friendly concern for his interests.
</p>
<p>It was a very happy party that night.
Both girls were merry, and Nolan was really
more solicitously attentive to Sally than was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span>
quite necessary even in the interests of a
campaign directed against her. When at a
late hour, they trooped out to the car, it
was he who helped her carefully into the
machine, though, with seeming reluctance, he
permitted Timothy to sit with her while he
joined Eveley in the front seat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Timmy is good-looking, don&#8217;t you think?&#8221;
Sally asked that night, as they were preparing
for bed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, if he did not work so hard. Young
men should not kill themselves with labor.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your Nolan is handsomer, perhaps,&#8221; said
Sally pleasantly.
</p>
<p>The next day Timothy did meet them for
luncheon, after keeping them waiting for
twenty minutes, and later they went for a
fast ride out Point Loma. But that night he
did not see them at all, though he told Eveley
he thought she was rather rubbing it in,
cheating him out of so many pleasant parties
and good times.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I may not want to marry her, but it is
good sport chasing around,&#8221; he protested.
</p>
<p>But Eveley was very stern. He had put
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
himself in her hands, and he must obey without
argument, and that settled it. And when
he suggested that it would look better if
he and Sally had one party by themselves
without Nolan tagging at their heels, she
frowned it down.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One private party can spoil a whole week
of hard work,&#8221; she decreed.
</p>
<p>So the week passed. Once even Eveley pretended
business, and Sally and Nolan had
luncheon together, and a drive later in Eveley&#8217;s
car. But Timothy put a stop to that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is my fiancée. And I may have to
marry her after all. And if I do, hanged if
I want everybody in town thinking she was
Nolan&#8217;s sweetheart to begin with.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Eveley waived that part of her plan, and
the parties were always of three, and sometimes,
but infrequently, of four. That Sally
accepted their arrangements so easily, and
took so much pleasure in their entertainment,
argued well. One night she said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course, men have to work, but I
shouldn&#8217;t like my husband to dig away like
a servant, should you, Eveley?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></p>
<p>And Eveley felt the time was ripe. The
next day she told Timothy he might take
Sally out alone in the car for a drive, and ask
her if they should not be married right away.
Eveley was willing to wager that she would
reject him. Timothy consented with alacrity,
seeming to feel the burden of his semi-attached
state.
</p>
<p>That evening at six-thirty, when Nolan
came up for dinner, Eveley met him on the
roof garden over the sun parlor.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolan, something has happened. They
went at two o&#8217;clock, and they aren&#8217;t home yet.
What do you suppose is the matter? Maybe
they had an accident. Maybe she got mad
and wouldn&#8217;t ride home with him. He
wouldn&#8217;t put her out, would he? Shall we
notify the police?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not. Don&#8217;t worry. Let&#8217;s
have our dinner. They can eat the leavings
when they come. He has probably learned,
as other and wiser men have learned, that a
pretty and pleasant girl is not half bad company.
I&#8217;ll bet he is having the time of his
life. My, it is nice to have you alone again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
She is very sweet, and it&#8217;s been lots of fun,
but after all I am used to you, and this is
nicer.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan&#8217;s prediction proved far from wrong.
At ten-thirty, a messenger boy shouted up
from below, and Nolan ran down. When he
came back he carried a small yellow slip addressed
to Eveley, which he promptly opened.
And as she peered over his shoulder, they
read it aloud, together, in solemn chorus.
</p>
<div class='blockquot'>
<p>&#8220;Three cheers and a tiger. She has accepted
me, and we were married at Oceanside
this afternoon. On our way to Yosemite
for honeymoon. I am the happiest man on
earth. Tell Nolan to go to the dickens. Love
from Sally and Timothy Baldwin.&#8221;
</p>
</div>
<p>Nolan lit a cigar and blew reflective rings
into the air. &#8220;When a man is bitten with the
germ of duty,&#8221; he began somberly.
</p>
<p>For a moment Eveley was crushed. Then
she rallied. &#8220;Just as I told you, Nolan. As
long as it was a painful duty, marriage between
them was impossible, and would have
wrecked both their lives. But our campaign
brought about the proper adjustment and
tuned them to love again. So it was not duty,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
but love, and marriage is a joy. Now I hope
you are convinced that I am right, and won&#8217;t
argue with me any more. And if I ever had
any doubts about that one exception I make
in regard to duty, they are all gone now. I
am dead sure of my one exception.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But when Nolan pressed her for an explanation,
she begged him to smoke again, and
let her think.

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE REVOLT OF THE SEVENTH STEP</h3>
</div>

<p>The sharp tap on Eveley&#8217;s window was
followed by an impatient brushing aside
of the curtains, and Miriam Landis swung
gracefully over the sill in a cloud of chiffon
and silk.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lem is waiting in the car,&#8221; she began
quickly, &#8220;but I came up to show you my new
gown. Are you nearly ready? Lem is so
impatient, you know.&#8221; Fumbling with the
fasteners of her wide cape she drew it back
and revealed a bewilderingly beautiful creation
beneath.
</p>
<p>Eveley went into instant and honest raptures.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you like it, Eveley? Am I beautiful in
it?&#8221; There was a curious wistfulness in her
voice, and Eveley studied her closely.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you are beautiful in it. You are
a dream. You are irresistibly heavenly.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder if Lem thinks so,&#8221; said Miriam,
half breathlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, you little goose,&#8221; cried Eveley, forcing
the laughter. &#8220;How could he think anything
else? There, he is honking for us already.
We must hurry&mdash;Why, Miriam, you
silly, how could any one think you anything
in the world but matchlessly wonderful in
anything&mdash;especially in a dream like that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miriam fastened her wrap again silently,
and got carefully out through the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Twelve steps,&#8221; cautioned Eveley. &#8220;You&#8217;d
better count them, it is so dark, or you may
stumble at the bottom.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miriam, clinging to the railing on one side,
passed slowly down. &#8220;One, two, three, four,
five, six.&#8221; Then she stopped and turned.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Seven.&#8221; Looking somberly up to Eveley,
standing above her, her face showing pale
and sorry in the dim light, she said, &#8220;I have
been married five years, Eve. You do not
know what it is to spend five years struggling
to maintain your charm for your husband.
And never knowing whether you have
failed or won. Always wondering why he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_177' name='page_177'></a>177</span>
finds more attraction in other women less
beautiful and less clever. Always wondering,
always afraid, trying to cling to what ought
to be yours without effort. It isn&#8217;t funny,
Eveley.&#8221; She turned slowly, to go on down,
but Eveley laid a restraining hand on her
arm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Five years? That is a long time,&#8221; she
said in a tender voice. &#8220;It must almost be
his turn now. Five years seems very long
to me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miriam passed on down the stairs, counting
aloud, eight, nine, ten, and on to the last.
At the last step she turned again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is my husband, Eveley. One must do
what is right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes? Yet five years of duty does not
seem to have brought you much happiness.
At least you should not be selfish. You ought
not to deny him the pleasure of doing his by
you for the next five.&#8221; Then she added apologetically:
&#8220;Forgive me, Miriam. You know
I should never have mentioned this if you
hadn&#8217;t spoken.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miriam clung to her hand as they felt their
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
way carefully around the house, Lem in the
machine still honking for them to hurry.
</p>
<p>At the corner she paused again. &#8220;You are
very clever, aren&#8217;t you, Eveley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, yes, I rather think I am,&#8221; admitted
Eveley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How would you go about it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The way Lem does,&#8221; came the quick retort,
and Miriam laughed, suddenly and
lightly.
</p>
<p>She was very quiet as they drove down
Fifth Street. Only once she spoke.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was the seventh step, wasn&#8217;t it,
Eveley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the seventh.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Revolution of the Seventh Step,&#8221; she
said, laughing again.
</p>
<p>This was nonsense to Lem Landis, but he
did not ask questions. Women always talked
such rot to each other. And he was wondering
if Mrs. Cartle would surely be at the ball?
</p>
<p>&#8220;The way Lem does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The words were startlingly sufficient.
From five years of painful experience, Mrs.
Landis knew how Lem did it. And so on this
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
evening, as she stood beside him in a corner
of the ballroom after their first greetings,
and looked as he did with eager speculative
eyes about the wide room, seeking, seeking,
she felt a curious sympathy and harmony between
herself and her husband. She knew
without turning her head when the sudden
brightening in his eyes came; and then he
slowly made his way to the dim corner where
Mrs. Cartle sat waiting.
</p>
<p>But Miriam was not so quickly satisfied.
There was Dan O&#8217;Falley, but his was such
fulsome effrontery. There was Clifford Eggleton,
but he had been a sweetheart of
Miriam&#8217;s in the old days before Lem came,
and that seemed hardly fair. There was Hal
Jervis, but he was too utterly wax in woman&#8217;s
hands to give her any semblance of thrill.
Then her eyes rested on a profile in another
corner of the room&mdash;a dark sleek head, a
dark thin face, and the clear outline of one
merry eye. Miriam appraised the head speculatively.
Who in the world could it be?
That merry eye looked very enticing. Ah,
now she could see better&mdash;he was talking to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
the Merediths. Then the merry-eyed one
was a stranger&mdash;so much the better, the uncertainty
of him pleased her. She was very
weary of those she knew so well. She moved
happily that way, suddenly surprised to know
that she was not at all concerned because
her husband sat in the distant corner with
Mrs. Cartle. She felt for him to-night only
a whimsical comradeship. Stopping many
times on her way to exchange a word and a
smile, she finally drew near the corner where
the sleek dark head and the merry eye had
drawn her. Mrs. Meredith, seeing her, came
to meet her, and drew her forward impulsively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miriam, you must meet our friend,
Mr. Cameron. He has only just come here
to be with my husband in business, and we
are going to love him, I know.&#8221; And so immediately
Miriam found herself looking directly,
and with great pleasure, full into the
merry eyes. The gown was beautiful upon
her, she knew it positively, whether Lem had
been stirred by the vision or not.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she is lovely enough,&#8221; said Billy
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
Meredith plaintively. &#8220;But don&#8217;t be lured by
her, Cameron. She is still in love with her
husband.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miriam smiled at her victim with disarming
friendliness. &#8220;But I like to be amused,&#8221;
she said. &#8220;And I have been married long
enough now to feel like playing again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Cameron laughed at that, and the laughter
fulfilled the promise of the merry eye.
Miriam was quite intoxicated with the game
her husband had taught her. That Eveley
was a clever little thing, wasn&#8217;t she?
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose we dance then,&#8221; Cameron suggested
eagerly. &#8220;It is the approved method
of beginning to play.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We resign you to your fate,&#8221; sighed Billy
Meredith once more. &#8220;I warned you, you
laughed me to scorn. Now plunge and die.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He seems to think I am dangerous,&#8221; said
Miriam, as they stepped lightly away to the
call of the music.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, far be it from me to say he is
wrong. But I am sure you will prove a
charming playfellow. You seem fairly to
match my own mood. I suppose we can not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
climb trees and go nutting and fishing and
wade in the creek as we might have done
together years ago, but if you will be patient
and teach me your way of playing in your
ladyhood, I think you will find me an apt,
and certainly a willing playmate.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then let&#8217;s begin to-morrow night. Come
to my house, and let&#8217;s play pool. It is the
most reckless thing we can do. I have a
sweet little friend and she has a deadly admirer,
and they will come with us. She is
very clever, too, and full of fun. See, that is
she there, dancing&mdash;the one with the golden
frock. Her name is Eveley Ainsworth and
the solemn young man is Nolan Inglish, and
they are unannounced but accepted sweethearts.
You are not afraid of Friend Husband,
then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not until Friend Husband gets afraid of
me,&#8221; he said.
</p>
<p>Later in the evening, as they were having
ices in a wonderful nook in the ballroom, he
said seriously, and with no laughter in the
merry eyes:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you trying to make a truant husband
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
jealous? Just be frank with me, and I will
do my best. I know you wanted a pal to-night.
Do you mind telling me why?&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment she hesitated. Then she
smiled. &#8220;If my frankness loses me a pleasant
comrade I shall regret my candor. But I do
want to play fairly with you. So hear then
the bitter truth. I have been married five
years, and I have worked like a common slave
to make myself beautiful and winsome and
irresistible to my husband. And you know
that a wife can&#8217;t do it, if the husband isn&#8217;t in
the mind for it. And so to-night I am starting
a revolution. I do not want to struggle
forever. I want to play and be happy. I
have no notion of making my husband jealous.
That has not even occurred to me. I
just want to be joyful&mdash;to learn to be joyful&mdash;regardless
of him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then may I be a disagreeable old preacher,
and say one thing? You know this may
be fun, but sometimes it is dangerous. Human
beings are not machines, and often they
make mistakes and fall in love, when they
had only meant to play. You would not find
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
it at all pleasant to be married to one man,
and in love with another. And maybe you
would not enjoy having a husband and a
lover in two persons, I am not trying to
foretell the future, or make unpleasant predictions&mdash;I
am only sounding the warning
note.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miriam considered this very solemnly.
Then she said: &#8220;Well, I think I should not
mind. It does not seem to bother Lem to be
married to me, and at the same time be involved
in stirring friendships with other
people.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just one more sermon then, and I am
through,&#8221; he said, laughing. &#8220;It is this.
Men and women are very different. A man
can play his head off with a dozen women,
and still stay in love with his wife, and want
no one but her. But a really nice woman, and
you are awfully nice, can not have love-affairs
without love. When she loves a man,
she wants him, and will not have any one
else. Your husband can have a dozen affairs,
and still want you. But if you have a pleasant
affair&mdash;you may not want your husband.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, of course, Mr. Preacher, one must
take a chance. And it is to be only play, you
know. That must be understood right in the
start. I am really not a bit advanced nor
modern, nor anything. I have no forward
ideas in my head. I am just tired of trying
to please my husband; I want some one to
please me. It does not seem to offer you
much for your pains, does it? But you may
find me fairly amusing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure of it,&#8221; he agreed warmly. &#8220;And
it is all settled, and we are going to play together.
And if sometimes you get tired of
me, and fire me off, I shall bob up serenely
the next day and start over, just as we might
have done when we were little children.&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Miriam reported her progress in revolution
to Eveley the next day, Eveley was
greatly perturbed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You went too fast,&#8221; she said with a frown.
&#8220;And besides&mdash;it is not fair. He isn&#8217;t married.
He will fall in love with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, we have a regular understanding,&#8221;
said Miriam confidently. &#8220;It is all settled according
to rules, and we are only going to
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span>
play. Lem goes to his club to-night, and
you and Nolan are to come and play pool
with us. Doesn&#8217;t it sound emancipated and
free?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Almost bolshevistic,&#8221; said Eveley grimly.
&#8220;I do not approve of it&mdash;not exactly&mdash;though
I do think you are justified. But it is so
risky&mdash;and people talk&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Eveley, I think it is better to have
people say, &#8216;What do you think of the way
Miriam Landis is carrying on?&#8217; than &#8216;Isn&#8217;t
Miriam Landis a little fool not to get next to
her husband in all these years?&#8217; Shouldn&#8217;t
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, we&#8217;ll be there,&#8221; said Eveley evasively.
&#8220;We&#8217;ll be right there. If he just wasn&#8217;t
so good-looking, and sort of&mdash;decent? Why
didn&#8217;t you pick out a roue? They are lots
safer than these decent young chaps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan, always a willing sacrifice when
Eveley bade, joined them without demur, and
a more rollickingly gay time they had never
had. Even Eveley admitted that things
seemed innocent and harmless enough, but
she shook her head.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span></p>
<p>&#8220;He is too good,&#8221; she whispered to Miriam.
&#8220;When he falls, he will fall hard. And if he
is once in love, I have a feeling he will work
like&mdash;like the dickens&mdash;and you haven&#8217;t much
spinal column yourself, you know. And I do
not believe in home wreckers, and things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan, also, frankly disapproved.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t make any difference what kind
of husband she&#8217;s got,&#8221; he said decidedly. &#8220;As
long as he is her husband, it is her duty to
stick to him and leave other men alone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t say duty to me,&#8221; said Eveley crossly.
&#8220;Five years is long enough for any woman
to do her duty. I think she is quite
justified in giving Lem a good scare. Maybe
he will wake up, and behave himself. But
this Gordon is too good-looking, and too desperately
nice. How can they play together
like two children? You know what will happen.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it has already happened. He is
head over heels right now, and she is not
breaking her heart over Lem, either. I give
them two weeks to develop a first-rate rash.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But Miriam believes in duty,&#8221; said Eveley
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
hopefully. &#8220;Maybe that will save them. She
would never elope with him, and I do not
think he would even ask her, he is so sort of
respectable and set.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Nolan was pessimistic. &#8220;Folks talk
about duty until they fall in love, and then
they forget it and everything else. And Lem
has acted abominably. I thought she did not
know it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;So did I. But&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, no use to worry. We&#8217;ll stick around
with them and sort of boss the job. I am
glad you invited them to the Cote to-morrow
night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And for supper, too. When Lem finds
she is coming here for a supper party and he
is left out, he may begin to think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The trouble with Lem is, he can&#8217;t help
himself. He loves Miriam all right, but women
go to his head. He may get jealous and
promise everything on heaven and earth, but
he can&#8217;t keep his word.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then he shouldn&#8217;t have married.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She should never have married him.
When women understand that a man who can
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_189' name='page_189'></a>189</span>
not look at a woman before marriage without
making love to her&mdash;can&#8217;t do it afterward&mdash;they
will save themselves a lot of trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Eveley hopefully. &#8220;No one
can say you hurt yourself making love.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the playing went on, Nolan and Eveley
acting as constant and merry chaperons, and
the little grouping grew more and more congenial.
Lem realized that a convulsion was
going on in his home, and reformed desperately
for days at a time, but a secluded corner
and a lovely woman invariably set him
pleading for forgiveness. Miriam always forgave
him promptly and said it did not bother
her; and was at first frightened, and then delighted,
to know that it truly did not bother
her any more.
</p>
<p>Then one evening, Eveley had a mad telephone
call from Lem, quickly followed by a
flying rush to her little Cote.
</p>
<p>&#8220;See what you&#8217;ve done,&#8221; he shouted, half-way
through the window. &#8220;That is what
comes of your interference. Miriam was the
most contented woman on earth till you began
feeding her up on this notion of revenge.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You sit down and talk sense, Lem Landis,
or get out,&#8221; said Eveley. &#8220;Contented! She
hasn&#8217;t known a contented day since she married
you. You have had five years of jollying
with other women. Now because another
man smiles on her, you go into a rage and
tear your hair. You make me sick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Look here, Eveley, you got me into this,
and you&#8217;ve got to get me out. I didn&#8217;t care
how much they smiled. I thought at first it
was a put-up job to make me jealous, and I
laughed at it. But it has gone too far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Everything is all right,&#8221; said Eveley
soothingly. &#8220;They are just playing. Nolan
and I are with them all the time. There is
nothing serious between them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be a fool,&#8221; he said rudely. &#8220;You
know that men and women can&#8217;t play like
kids. Miriam wants a divorce.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley sat down and swallowed hard.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A divorce,&#8221; he raged, champing wildly up
and down the small room. &#8220;She says there
is nothing between them, and she does not
love him, but she can&#8217;t stand me any more.
Why can&#8217;t she stand me? She stood me for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
five years. What&#8217;s come over her all of a
sudden that she says it makes her sick to kiss
me? She won&#8217;t even let me hold her hand.
She says it is blasphemous. Blasphemy to
touch my own wife&#8217;s hand! You know what
that means, don&#8217;t you? She is in love with
that&mdash;that&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t swear here,&#8221; Eveley broke in
quickly. &#8220;I won&#8217;t have it. I think you are
mistaken, Lem. She doesn&#8217;t want a divorce.
Not really. She wouldn&#8217;t, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But she does, I tell you. She says it is
sacrilege to live with me, and so she is going
off by herself to desert me, and says I&#8217;ve got
to get a divorce on those grounds when the
time is up, or heaven only knows what she&#8217;ll
do. Now, you got us into this mess, and
you&#8217;ve got to stop it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do what I can, Lem,&#8221; she promised.
&#8220;And so will Nolan. But between you and
me, I do not blame her. I wouldn&#8217;t have lived
with you two months, myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I have never wanted another woman in
my life,&#8221; he said brokenly. &#8220;It has always
been Miriam with me from the very minute
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
I saw her. I have fooled around a lot, I know,
but it&#8217;s always been Miriam for serious.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said bitterly. &#8220;That is it. It is
just as Gordon says. A man can fool around
and still love his wife. But a nice woman
can&#8217;t. She is strong for one man&mdash;at a time.
When she falls for a new one, it is all off with
the last. You could love a dozen at a time,
but Miriam is too nice for that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you promised&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I&#8217;ll do what I can, and I will advise
her to stick it out, but I think she will
be very foolish if she takes my advice.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan was immediately summoned, and a
desperate struggle began with Miriam. But
it was really no struggle.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, Eveley,&#8221; she said reproachfully, &#8220;I
am surprised at you. Can&#8217;t you see that a
woman can not live with a man she dislikes?
It makes the shivers run down my back when
he touches me. It&mdash;isn&#8217;t nice. It&mdash;makes
me feel like&mdash;well, not at all right. You can
see that, can&#8217;t you, Nolan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am afraid I can.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he is your husband,&#8221; protested
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
Eveley. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it your place as his wife to&mdash;to&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mean my duty, dear?&#8221; asked
Miriam, smiling faintly. &#8220;I am surprised at
you, Eve. No dear, it isn&#8217;t. Your theory
that duty is happiness is half right. But a
woman has one other duty also&mdash;self-respect.
I am all packed up, dear, and going to-morrow.
You do not mind my not leaving my
address, do you? I want to go off very quietly
by myself. I do not want Gordon to know. I
am afraid he will blame himself for it. You
will make him see that it was not he, at all,
won&#8217;t you? And after it is all over, I shall
write, or maybe come to see you. You will
ask him not to look for me, won&#8217;t you? There
has not been a thing serious between us,
Eveley, you believe that, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I do. I know it. I&#8217;ve chaperoned
you two till I am fairly sick of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miriam smiled again. &#8220;Be sure to tell him
everything I said, will you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan and Eveley were very quiet after
she had gone. And Eveley cried a little.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope she will be happy,&#8221; she said tearfully.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She will be. Gordon will wait for her, and
not crowd her. He is like me. He can talk
to a woman without loving her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You can, at least.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At least, I do not talk about it all the
time,&#8221; he amended. &#8220;What I mean is that
his affection is for the one, and not for the
sex.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think she did right, Nolan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think it is my duty to judge,&#8221; he
evaded cleverly. &#8220;She had one chance for
happiness, and she lost. Now she is to have
one more. We are her friends, and we love
her. We can not begrudge her one more opportunity,
can we?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No indeed, and you put it very nicely,&#8221;
she said more comfortably. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it nice
that we do not believe in duty? But we shall
miss them. They were very nice playmates
for us, as well as for each other&mdash;Nolan,
there was something sort of sweet about
Lem, after all? Something very human and
lovable and&mdash;but of course it was Miriam&#8217;s
duty to be happy.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>SHE FINDS A FOREIGNER</h3>
</div>

<p>Eveley had very nearly lost faith in assimilation.
She had thought it over
carefully, attempted it conscientiously and
decided it could not be done.
</p>
<p>&#8220;One individuality can not be absorbed by
another,&#8221; she would say very sagely. &#8220;Whether
it is husbands and wives, or whether it is
nations. The theorists are right in stating
that America is for Americans only, and that
it is the patriotic duty of those who come
here to be Americanized as rapidly as possible,
and the duty of the regular Americans
to Americanize everybody else at top speed&mdash;but
it can not be done. They are they, and
we are we. It may be our duty, but we are
not big enough.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She did not call her friendship with Angelo
Moreno by any such big and formal term as
assimilation. They had just grown to be
enormously good friends. She had forgotten
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
about Americanizing him, but she found him
charming, with the fresh frank abandon of
the unspoiled south-European. She liked his
open admiration, she enjoyed his mature cynicism,
she reveled in his buoyant enthusiasm.
She had not believed that such opposing elements
could dwell in one small person. In
Angelo, she found them, and she found the
combination good.
</p>
<p>He was helpful to Eveley, as well as pleasing.
He did endless small jobs for her about
the car and upon the lawn of her home. And
when she noticed that he quickly adopted
some of her own little customs of speech and
manner, she was freshly pleased and interested.
</p>
<p>Still she could not harden her heart to the
clamorous call of the world struggle. She
lived so happily and so securely in her Cloud
Cote, going to business by day, doing her
small bits of housework in between whiles,
frolicking with her friends, chumming with
Angelo, playing with her sister&#8217;s babies, running
about in her pretty car. It was like living
in the clouds indeed, with the world of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_197' name='page_197'></a>197</span>
chaos beneath. For there was the struggle
of reconstruction going on, the tremendous
heave and pull of masses seeking to dominate,
the subtle writhe and twist of politics, a
whole world straining and sinewing to rise
dominant out of the molten bed of human
lava left from the volcanic eruption of war.
</p>
<p>And although Eveley still lived serene in
her Cloud Cote, it was like living on the edge
of the crater of a volcano. The eruption
would come, must come. And when it came,
her pretty Cloud Cote might be caught in the
upheaval. Sometimes in the evening she
stood breathless in the little pavilion on the
edge of the canyon stretching down below
her home, and looked far into the shadows.
Being a vivid imaginer, down in the darkness
she seemed to see the world in turmoil,
and although she stood above it on the
heights, she knew that when the final reckoning
came, there would be no heights and no
canyon.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the only thing that can stop it is
Americanization, and it is impossible,&#8221; she
would say helplessly. &#8220;And there you are.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></p>
<p>But being of a light and happy heart, she
tried to forget, and plunged into her work
and her play once more. The consciousness,
however, of a world in travail was always
with her.
</p>
<p>This was why, when Amos Hiltze came to
her with an appeal for help in a new phase
of Americanization, he found such prompt
and eager interest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not much, Miss Ainsworth,&#8221; he said
earnestly, &#8220;and to you it may seem very aimless
and trifling indeed. But it is something
definite at least, a real tangible piece of
Americanization, and you are the only woman
I know who can help us out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, yes,&#8221; she cried eagerly. &#8220;I will,
of course. What is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is a girl, a Spanish girl from Mexico.
Her relatives joined the revolutionists, and
pouf,&mdash;were blown out. By rare good fortune
she escaped across the border. But what
chance has she? No friends,&mdash;no training.
She has never learned to meet and mingle
with people. And now after the years of horror,
she is afraid. She has lost her nerve.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
She needs a place where she can be alone, and
quiet, with no one to observe or criticize. I
can vouch for the girl, that she is all right.
And I wondered if your spirit of Americanization
would carry you to the point of temporarily
adopting her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mercy!&#8221; gasped Eveley, thinking with
great tenderness of her cozy little Cloud Cote,
her home, and hers alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know it is asking a great deal, but it
will only be for a few weeks. Just until some
proper arrangements can be made for her.
Unless she is taken care of, and quickly, she
will fall a prey to some anarchistic Bolshevik,
or something worse. She is living with a
bunch of low Mexicans away out in the country,
and the Greasers come there from all
around,&mdash;and I am afraid for the girl. If she
can be taken now, treated kindly, shown the
charm and wholesomeness of American customs
and principles, she will be won for
America. A beautiful girl, educated, talented,
charming. Think what a power she can be
in the Americanization of her people, when
she herself has been given love and tenderness
and confidence.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span></p>
<p>Eveley decided instantly. &#8220;Very well, bring
her. I can move the extra furniture out of
the east bedroom, and store it in the garage,
and she may have that room. She will be
alone and quiet all day. But I hardly know a
word of Spanish&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she speaks English perfectly. You
are a wonderful girl, Miss Ainsworth. Not
one in a thousand would have risen to such a
sacrifice. If American women were all like
you, there would be no need of Americanization.
A country stands or falls by its women-kind.
And you will not find her burdensome.
She does not wish to meet people, her only
desire is to be quiet, and let alone. She will
keep your little home tidy for you, and she
likes to cook and sew. She will not bother
you much. How soon can you have her
come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It will take about two hours to get
ready. Can you come and help me to-night?
Angelo will help, too. We must move the furniture
and boxes out, and then the room will
be ready for her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then suppose we go for her to-night? She
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
is about forty miles out in the back country
in a little shack a mile off the Viejas grade.
If we could leave about supper-time, we&#8217;d get
there a little after dark. She wants to slip
away without attracting attention. She is a
nervous wreck, literally scared to death. It
will take a long time to give her confidence
again, but if any one can do it, it is you. Her
faith in humankind has been bitterly shattered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley was fairly quivering with excitement
and delight. Her faith in herself had
gone leaping skyward. She was not a slacker,
not a quitter. She was a regular American
after all, making a real sacrifice for a principle
she believed in,&mdash;and oh, how she was
going to assimilate this pretty little Mexican!
Poor child! Of course she was shattered and
stunned and shocked. Who wouldn&#8217;t be?
Things must have been ghastly in Mexico.
Eveley herself was rather vague on the subject,
because her philosophy was one of
peace and joy, and she found that reading of
affairs in Mexico did not tend to increase
either peace or joy. But she was dimly aware
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
that the spirit of unrest prevailing in all the
world had risen to open and bloody warfare
across the Rio Grande.
</p>
<p>Her work suffered very sadly that afternoon,
and long before the appointed hour she
was ringing furiously for the elevator. From
her incoherent chatter on the way down, Angelo
gathered that he was literally to fly to
her the very minute he was off duty, and
then she was clambering blindly into the
car and rushing around for Mr. Hiltze.
</p>
<p>She was quite in an ecstasy as they set
about moving out the pieces of furniture to
be stored in the back of the big garage, and
fitting up an attractive home for the wounded
little Mexican who was to be her guest,&mdash;and
her food for assimilation.
</p>
<p>Amos Hiltze was a great help, and worked
with enthusiasm.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do what I can, but men are helpless
when it comes to women. And when I knew
of this child,&mdash;well, I thought of you. If you
refused, I had no notion where to turn. But
you did not refuse.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, indeed,&#8221; chirped Eveley. &#8220;I am only
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
too happy. I want to do things, real things,
and be of use. It&mdash;it is right, I suppose, and
lots of fun besides.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At six o&#8217;clock Angelo came, and looked for
a moment with speculative eyes upon Mr.
Hiltze. He was not enthusiastic,&mdash;rather he
was frankly pessimistic.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you send her to a hotel?&#8221; he
demanded aggressively. &#8220;You don&#8217;t want a
dirty Greaser in here, messing things all up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Angelo, you mustn&#8217;t,&#8221; protested Eveley,
deeply shocked. &#8220;She isn&#8217;t a Greaser.
She is a high caste Mexican girl.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There ain&#8217;t no such thing,&#8221; he said gloomily.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll see. She&#8217;ll litter the whole place
up with a lot of smelly bandits, and they&#8217;ll
cut your throat, and steal your money, and
then where&#8217;ll you be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Amos Hiltze turned on him, with
something compelling in his eyes. &#8220;Cut out
that nonsense, and mind your own business.
This is not your affair.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Angelo resigned himself to the inevitable,
and fell to work, not with good will,
but with efficiency. And when the room was
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
ready, while the man and boy were carrying
the extra furniture out to the garage for
storage, Eveley hastily prepared a light supper
for the three of them. It was eaten in
utter silence. Eveley was excited almost to
the point of suffocation, and the others were
immersed in their own thoughts. She hastily
cleared the dishes from the table, and put on
her heavy coat and a small hat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where do you go to get your Spanish
queen?&#8221; demanded Angelo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, a long way out in the country,&#8221; said
Eveley nervously. &#8220;We must hurry, Angelo.
It is getting late.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going in your car?&#8221; he persisted.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. Now, please, Angelo, I hate to rush
you off, but we must go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Take me along, Miss Eveley. Please&mdash;you&#8217;ve
got plenty of room. Won&#8217;t you take
me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing doing,&#8221; cut in Amos Hiltze
shortly. &#8220;We&#8217;ve got to keep the girl quiet,
and you would let out some rudeness that
would spoil everything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Honest I won&#8217;t, Miss Eveley. G&#8217;wan, be
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
a sport. You promised to take me for a night
ride, and you never have. I won&#8217;t say a word
to the Grea&mdash;lady, honest I won&#8217;t. Be a sport,
Miss Eveley, sure I can go along.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take him,&#8221; said Eveley. &#8220;He can sit
in front with me coming back, and you can
ride with Marie. He won&#8217;t say a word, will
you, Angelo?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Hiltze seemed not altogether satisfied,
but Angelo was already half-way down the
rustic stairs and headed for the garage, so
he contented himself with one final word of
warning.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Just keep quiet,&#8221; he said to Angelo. &#8220;Do
not even look at her. There must be no fuss
or confusion, or she will be afraid to come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a heavy fog rolling up through
the canyons, and Eveley, in her state of excitement,
found the car prone to leap wildly
through the misty white darkness. There
was a great ringing in her ears, and her
pulses were pounding. Hiltze at her side was
silent and preoccupied, and Angelo in the
rear sat huddled in a corner, in the rug which
Eveley had tucked about him.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We do not want any frozen passengers to
bring home,&#8221; she had said, with a smile.
</p>
<p>They spun swiftly along University, slowing
for East San Diego where there were
officers with bad reputations among speeders,
through La Mesa, the cross on Mt.
Helix showing faintly in the pale moonlight,
through El Capon, out beyond Flynn Springs
where the pavement left off.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you tired?&#8221; asked the man, stirring
closer to Eveley&#8217;s side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, with a laugh that was
really a sob. &#8220;But I am so out of breath, and
thrilled, and&mdash;all stirred up, like a silly little
schoolgirl. I believe I am frightened.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not be frightened, Miss Eveley,&#8221; said
Angelo suddenly, reassuringly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll look
after you. If we do not like the little Greaser,
we&#8217;ll just ditch her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not be afraid,&#8221; said Hiltze,
pressing his arm companionably against her
elbow. &#8220;You know I will take care of you.
And you will like the girl. She is just a timid,
nerve-racked child. You will love her in time.
But this is not a question of love, only of
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
service,&mdash;one phase of the scheme of Americanization
that is sweeping the country. It
has to come through the women, Eveley, you
know that. It has to be born into the babies
of the next generation.&#8221;
</p>
<p>An audible sniff came from the back seat,
but Angelo was lustily clearing his throat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You sound like a stump speaker,&#8221; he said
critically. &#8220;Did you get that way selling
autos, or did you used to be an agitator or
something?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mr. Hiltze made no reply. He was leaning
forward now, anxiously scanning the road.
&#8220;We turn soon. Drive slowly, please. I do not
know the road very well. Oh,&mdash;there it is,&mdash;I
see it now. Just beyond the little clump of
trees, this side of the big rock. Turn to the
right,&mdash;the road is safe enough, but a little
rough. We only go a little farther,&mdash;yes, to
the right a little more,&mdash;down-grade, but it
is not very steep. Now, pull off a little and
stop. Yes, you wait here now, will you, while
I go on to the shack? The road does not lead
up to it. You need not be afraid, you are close
to the main road though you can not see it
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
for the shrubs and rocks. She does not want
the Mexicans to know where nor how she
goes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be gone long?&#8221; asked Eveley,
gazing somewhat fearfully into the black
shadows about her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, just a few minutes. It is only a little
bit of a way, and Marie is ready to come at
once.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How does she know you are coming after
her?&#8221; asked Angelo.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I told her I would come to-night if I could
make arrangements for her, and she said she
would be ready. She has only a small bag, so
her preparations are simple. Now, don&#8217;t be
frightened, Eveley. You know I would not
leave you if there were any danger. Angelo
will be with you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You bet I will. Beat it, Mister, and cop
the lady.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley and Angelo listened in silence, as
Hiltze strode quickly away. When the last
sound had echoed to silence, Angelo leaned
over the seat, his thin dark face close to
Eveley&#8217;s.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_209' name='page_209'></a>209</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say, Miss Eveley, where did you pick up
that guy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He was the salesman who sold me my
car, but he has many friends who are my
friends also, so I have met him often. He
was only selling autos temporarily, and is
making plans now to go into business for
himself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll bet your friend Inglish ain&#8217;t stuck on
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not unnaturally,&#8221; admitted Eveley, laughing.
&#8220;He is not.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he&#8217;s a smart guy, Inglish is,&#8221; said
Angelo shrewdly. &#8220;You can pretty well put
it down he&#8217;s on the level about folks.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not seem partial to Mr. Hiltze,
Angelo. But he is most kind and sympathetic,
and no one works harder for the
Americanization of the foreign element than
he does.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lots of folks work hard for something
to keep the real things dark. I guess he&#8217;s
got a mash on this dame.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley was silent.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think so?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No, I hardly think so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t tell. Some guys can have
mashes on two or three at a time, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Angelo, please, let&#8217;s not talk this way. I
do not like it. And I do not wish my friends
to criticize my other friends. I know you
like Mr. Inglish best of all, and that is why
you try to underrate the others&mdash;but please
don&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I think he is smart enough,&#8221; said
Angelo ingratiatingly. &#8220;It ain&#8217;t that. I just
don&#8217;t like his wishing foreign dames off on
to you because you are easy and will stand
for it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen&mdash;they are coming.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Angelo got out then and clambered in beside
her, and they both peered into the darkness
whence footsteps came. The two were
walking slowly, Hiltze leading the girl carefully.
She walked shrinkingly, her face
showing deathly pale in the shadowy night.
</p>
<p>Eveley got out at once and went to meet
them, surprised at the great wave of tenderness
sweeping over her. She felt somehow
that it was a daughter of hers, coming
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span>
back to her out of suffering and sorrow. She
put her arms protectingly about the girl, and
kissed her cheek.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie,&#8221; she said softly, &#8220;you are going to
be my sister. I&mdash;I think I love you already.
I felt it when I saw you come out of the
darkness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The girl did not speak, but her slender fingers
closed convulsively about Eveley&#8217;s, and
there was a catch like a little sob in her
throat.
</p>
<p>Eveley herself helped her into the car, and
pulled the rugs and blankets about her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very foggy, and the air is cold. We
do not want a little sick girl on our hands.
Pull them close about you. Oh, your cape is
very light&mdash;you must take my furs. It is
much warmer in front, and I do not need
them. Now, are you all ready? This is my
little pal Angelo Moreno with me, but don&#8217;t
pay any attention to him to-night. You will
see him again. Now, all ready and off we go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Angelo sat silently musing in his corner
during the long ride back to town, and Eveley
sang softly almost beneath her breath. In
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
the back seat there was silence, too. Only
once Eveley turned to call to them blithely:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I was frightened and anxious at first, but
now I feel happy and full of hope. I think
you are going to bring me great good fortune,
Sister Marie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are&mdash;most heavenly kind,&#8221; said
Marie, in slow soft English, with the exquisite
toning of her Spanish tongue.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Marie,&#8221; cried Eveley rapturously.
&#8220;Those are the first words I ever heard you
say&mdash;such kind and loving words. I shall
never forget them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The rest of the ride was taken in absolute
silence, and at the door of her cottage when
she ran the car into the garage, Angelo carried
Marie&#8217;s bag up the steps silently, and
Hiltze helped her, while Eveley ran hospitably
in front to have the window open and
the lights on. She thrust out an eager hand
to help Marie through the window, and then
she gaily faced their escorts.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not to-night,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;You can not
come in even for a minute. Sister Marie and
I are going to have hot chocolate all by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
ourselves, and&mdash;and find out how we like each
other&#8217;s looks. Many thanks&mdash;good night.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she closed the window and turned to
the slender shrinking figure at her side, drawing
back the heavy hood that shielded the
girl&#8217;s face to look into the features of the
little foreign waif she had taken to her heart.

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>NEW LIGHT ON LOYALTY</h3>
</div>

<p>A quick thrill of pleasure swept over
Eveley as she looked into the face of
her young guest.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Duty?&#8221; No, it would be a joy to teach
this soft and lovely creature the glorious principles
of freedom, justice and equality. This
was Eveley&#8217;s sphere&mdash;she felt it&mdash;she knew
it. She took Marie&#8217;s slender hands in both
of hers, and squeezed them rapturously.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am so happy,&#8221; she cried ecstatically.
&#8220;I think you are adorable.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For Marie&#8217;s soft dark eyes, the soft waves
of dark hair drooping over the low forehead,
the slender oval of the olive tinted face, the
crimson curving lips, the shrinking figure
presented such a picture of exquisite helplessness
that Eveley&#8217;s brave and buoyant soul
rose leaping to the appeal.
</p>
<p>She removed the dark cape from Marie&#8217;s
shoulders, and took her bag, leading her into
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span>
the small east bedroom which had been so
charmingly dressed for her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is your home now, Marie, I hope for
a long, long time. It is your home, and you
are as free as a bird. You are not my servant,
but my sister and my friend. I want you
to be happy. You are to think as you like,
do as you like, go or stay as you like. You
are mistress of your own life, now and all
the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is very lovely,&#8221; said Marie softly.
&#8220;And you are an angel from Heaven.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a bit of it,&#8221; laughed Eveley. &#8220;You do
not know me. I am the humanest thing you
ever saw in your life.&#8221; She lifted Marie&#8217;s
bag lightly to a low table. &#8220;Now, this door
opens to the bath&mdash;my bedroom door leads
into it from the opposite side. And this is
your closet, and these drawers are all empty,
so use them as you wish. Why don&#8217;t you put
on a negligee, now, and rest? And while you
are alone for a minute, to collect yourself
and unpack your bag, I shall run out and put
on the chocolate. We must have a hot luncheon
after our cold ride. Are you very cold? I
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
think I&#8217;d better light the fire in your grate&mdash;it
is all ready. There, that is better now. If
I ever do get married I must certainly have
wonderful luck, if there is any faith in signs,
for I do build the fieriest fires. Now, do not
hurry, I&#8217;ll come back in a few minutes. I
think I shall put on a negligee too,&#8221; she
added, as Marie drew a silk gown from her
bag. &#8220;And then we&#8217;ll be surely settled down
and right at home together.&#8221;
</p>
<p>With a warm and dazzling smile, she ran
out to put the chocolate on the grill, and arrange
the sandwiches and fruit and cake on
the table around the bowl of drooping roses,
and then, humming blithely, hurried into her
own room to change from her heavy dress to
a soft house gown.
</p>
<p>When, a few moments later, she returned
to Marie, she found her standing pensively in
the center of the room, the heavy folds of a
dark red gown falling about her graceful figure,
her head sunk on her breast in reverie.
Eveley put her arms around her tenderly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are beautiful,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
worry, dear. You are going to be very happy,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
even yet. Just trust me&mdash;and&mdash;do you know
the song of the Belgian girl&mdash;Well, we shall
make an American Beauty of you, sure
enough. Just try to be happy, and have confidence
in me, Marie. I shall never go back
on you. My, how quick you were! Your
bag is all unpacked, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; She glanced
with quickly appraising eyes at the heavy
silver articles of toilet laid out on the dressing-table,
and at the gowns swinging from
the pole in the closet.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come along, baby sister,&#8221; she said affectionately,
&#8220;or the chocolate will run all over
the grill.&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was deep if unvoiced appreciation in
Marie&#8217;s eyes as she observed the fine heavy
furniture of the little dining-room, the lace
doilies on the mahogany table, the fine pieces
of china, and the drooping roses. Eveley led
her gaily to her place at the table, and sat
down beside her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We really ought to ask a blessing,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;I feel such a fountain of gratitude inside
of me. My own sister was ten years
older than I, and there were no babies afterward
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
for me to make a fuss over. This is a
brand-new experience, and I am just bubbling
over.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But I am no baby,&#8221; said Marie, smiling
the wistful smile that suggested tears and
heartaches. &#8220;I think I am quite as old as
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, impossible,&#8221; gasped Eveley. &#8220;Why,
I am twenty-five years old.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really!&#8221; mocked Marie, and she laughed&mdash;and
Eveley realized it was the first time
Marie had laughed. &#8220;Well, I am twenty-three
and a half.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you can&#8217;t be. Mr. Hiltze said you
were a child, and you are so little and slim
and young.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have been a woman, living a woman&#8217;s
life, with all a woman&#8217;s interests. But our
women are sheltered, kept away from life,
and that is why I am like a child in facing
the world&mdash;because I have never faced it. I
look young, and act young, because&mdash;well,
with us, our women marry early. If they
do not, they must retain the charm of youth
until they do. That is what we are taught,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_219' name='page_219'></a>219</span>
it is our business as women to be young and
lovely until we marry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I love to hear you talk,&#8221; said Eveley irrelevantly.
&#8220;You are just like a chapter out
of a new and thrilling story&mdash;See, I have let
my chocolate grow cold just looking at you,
and listening. I am very glad you are nearly
as old as I&mdash;we can not only be sisters, but
twins if you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Marie sipped her chocolate, daintily, dreamily.
Then she looked at Eveley searchingly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this your patriotism?&#8221; she asked at
last. &#8220;To throw open your home on a moment&#8217;s
notice, to a stranger from a strange
land?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We call it Americanization,&#8221; said Eveley.
&#8220;We call it the assimilation of&mdash;of&mdash;&#8221; She
hesitated, not wishing to speak of &#8220;flotsam
and jetsam&#8221; to this soft and pliant creature.
&#8220;We call it the assimilation of the whole
world into American ideals.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then,&#8221; said Marie slowly, dark eyes still
searching Eveley&#8217;s face, &#8220;I suppose, having
this vision of patriotism yourself, you can
understand patriotism of others from other
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
lands? You can understand why people plot,
and steal, and kill&mdash;for love of country? My
own land, for instance&mdash;so many call us
bloody butchers because we fight for our
country and for freedom. But you&mdash;you
know what patriotism is. And you can understand,
can you not?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I understand,&#8221; said Eveley
rather confusedly, for the Mexican business
was a terrible muddle to her. &#8220;I understand
that your men must fight to save their country
from the rebels and anarchists who would
wreck and ruin her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but&mdash;it is the rebels and anarchists
who would save her,&#8221; said Marie, with childish
earnestness. &#8220;I&mdash;we&mdash;I am of the revolutionists.
My father was killed. My brothers
were killed. My sisters were made captive.
But still the struggle goes on. The
best of our men must fight and die. Poor
Mexico must struggle and blunder on from
one disaster to another, until at last she rises
triumphant and free among the nations of the
world. It is those in power in her own land
from whom Mexico has most to fear&mdash;those
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
who would sell her, body and soul, land and
loyalty, to foreign devils for gold. It is not
against the outside world we fight&mdash;it is the
vile, the treacherous ones inside our borders.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But how can you tell who is for, and who
against?&#8221; asked Eveley bewildered. &#8220;They
all promise so much&mdash;and peace is assured&mdash;but
there is no peace. And who can tell
where freedom really lies?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas, it is true,&#8221; said Marie sadly. &#8220;But
those with eyes that see and hearts that love,
know that Mexico is still in the hands of traitors,
and that the spirit of revolution must
live.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you know more about it than
I do,&#8221; admitted Eveley. &#8220;We&mdash;we do not
understand the situation at all. I&mdash;think
perhaps they are too shrewd for us. Let&#8217;s not
talk of it&mdash;it excites you, dear. I want you
to rest and be quiet. I did not know that any
one could love&mdash;Mexico&mdash;like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you seen Mexico? Oh, not the dry,
barren border country, but my Mexico, rich
with jewels and gold, studded with magnificent
cities, flowering with rare fruits and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
spices, a mellow, golden, matchless land, peopled
by those who are skilled in arts and
science, lovers of beauty, and&mdash;Ah, you do
not know Mexico. You know only the half-breed
savages who run the borderland, preying
on Mexican and American alike. You do
not know the real Mexico of beautiful women,
and brave and gallant men. How could you
know?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then her voice became soft and dreamy
again. &#8220;I visited here long years ago. I was
out in your Old Town, where the Indian maid
Ramona lived. I stood in the square there.
Do you know the story, Eveley, of the early
days when your Captain Fremont and his
band of soldiers stood there, ready to lower
the flag of Mexico and to raise in its place
your Stars and Stripes? As your soldier
stepped forward to tear down our flag, a little
girl of Mexico, another Marie like me, who
was watching with aching heart from the
window of the &#8217;dobe house on the other side,
shocked at the outrage, leaped from the casement
forgetting her fear of the foreign soldiers,
and with one tug of her sharp knife
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
cut the rope. As the flag of Mexico fell, she
caught it in her bare hands, and pressed it
against her lips, her little form shaken with
sobs. &#8216;Forgive me,&#8217; she said to the soldiers,
but it is the flag of my country, I could not
see it dragged in the dust.&#8217;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley leaned over and put her hand on
Marie&#8217;s arm. &#8220;I have heard the story many
times, but I never caught the glory of it before.
It was the feeling in her that is in me
now&mdash;that is in all America&mdash;only ours is for
America, and hers was for Mexico&mdash;as yours
is.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;When I look at you, and know the tenderness
of you, and the great heart of you,
I feel that America must be the heaven of all
the world, and Americans the angels.&#8221; Then
Marie&#8217;s face darkened, and her lips became a
scarlet line. &#8220;But who then has stood heartlessly
by, and watched the writhing and anguish
of my Mexico, withholding the hand of
power that could bring peace? Who has
stood by and smiled while Mexico lay crushed
and bleeding beneath the heel of despotism
and treachery?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t understood, Marie,&#8221; begged
Eveley. &#8220;We could not understand. We&mdash;we
naturally trust people, we are like that,
you know, and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And whom can one trust? My faith has
been as my faith in God&mdash;yet when so many
falter, and then turn back in betrayal&mdash;how
can one trust? Perhaps we are all deceived&mdash;perhaps
every faction in my country is
seeking only to despoil and enslave.&#8221; Then
her face grew bright and luminous as she
said, &#8220;But there are those who are princes
of sacrifice and love, risking all their world,
their lives, their honor, for my Mexico. If
there be any faith, it is in them. You call
them bandits&mdash;Yes? I call them sons of
God.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley changed the subject as quickly as
she could. The bandits who had been driven
desperately from crag to cranny, berated in
the press, denounced in the pulpit, deprecated
on the platform&mdash;were these the princes of
Marie&#8217;s Mexico, the idols of their women&#8217;s
hearts, the saviors of their faith, their hope
of freedom? It was very confusing.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></p>
<p>She told Marie how she worked every day
down-town, and how the little Cloud Cote
would be her own all day, how she had friends
coming often in the evening, friends who
would love Marie, but whom she never need
to see except when her heart desired. And
she told of the lovely lawn, with its pavilions
and pergolas and crevices and vines, and of
the canyon drifting away down to the bay.
</p>
<p>And Marie sat with her chin in her hands,
her eyes soft and humble, dog-like, on
Eveley&#8217;s face.

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>SERVICE OF JOY</h3>
</div>

<p>It was not often that Eileen Trevis, who
was manifestly born for business, waxed
hysterically enthusiastic. And so one morning
a few days later, when an incoherent summons
came from her over the telephone, Eveley
was astonished almost to the point of
speechlessness.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221; she gasped. &#8220;What has happened?
Is it bad news?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Good, good, good,&#8221; exulted Eileen. &#8220;Wonderful,
delicious, thrilling. Please hurry. It
is nearly lunch-time, isn&#8217;t it? I have been
trying to get you all morning,&mdash;come quickly.&mdash;Never
mind about your luncheon.&mdash;Are
you coming?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am on the way,&#8221; shouted Eveley, crashing
the receiver on to its hook, and flying
with scant ceremony from the office, hoping
it was truly the luncheon hour, but scorning
to waste the time to look.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She is in love,&#8221; she said aloud as she ran
down the stairs, spurning a tardy elevator.
&#8220;She is in love, and she is engaged, or maybe
she has eloped and is already married. Eileen
Trevis,&mdash;of all people in the world. Whoever
would have thought it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Only the absence of traffic officers in that
part of the city kept Eveley from arrest that
day, and only the protection of Heaven itself
saved her from total wreckage, for she spun
around corners, and dodged traffic warts at
a rate that was positively neck-breaking. The
last block before she reached Eileen&#8217;s home
was one long coast, and she drew up sharply
with a triumphant honk.
</p>
<p>Eileen was on the steps before she had
time to turn off the engine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it a husband?&#8221; cried Eveley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, babies,&#8221; chortled Eileen.
</p>
<p>Eveley put her fingers over her lips, and
swallowed painfully.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t your turn,&#8221; she said disapprovingly.
&#8220;You have to do these things in proper
order. You can&#8217;t run backward. It isn&#8217;t
being done.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly,&#8221; said Eileen. &#8220;Hop out,
and come in. I am having a nursery made out
of the maid&#8217;s bedroom that has never been
used. It is perfectly dear, with blue Red-Riding-Hoods,
and blue wolves and blue
Jacks-and-Jills on a white background.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;There is something wrong about this,&#8221;
said Eveley solemnly, as she followed Eileen
into the house, and up the two flights of
stairs to her apartment.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is Ida&#8217;s babies, stupid,&#8221; explained Eileen
at last. &#8220;I am to have them after all. Poor
Jim&#8217;s sister is ill, and I must say, it almost
serves her right,&mdash;she was so snippy about
the children.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Ida&#8217;s babies! And has the Aunt-on-the-Other-Side-of-the-House
had a change of
heart?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, a regular one. Heart failure, they
call it. I tried so hard to get them when Ida
died, but Agnes flatly refused to give them
up and since her brother was their daddy and
he was alive, I could not do much. I asked
for them again, you know, when Jim died, and
she was ruder than ever. But since the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
dispensation of heart failure, she can not keep
them. I got a letter this morning, and wired
for them to start immediately and I just got
an answer that they will be here to-morrow
afternoon. Then I sent for the decorators.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You aren&#8217;t any mother for small children,&#8221;
protested Eveley, with an argumentative
wave of her hand. &#8220;You are born for
business. Everybody says so. You do not
know anything about babies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes I do,&#8221; cried Eileen ecstatically.
&#8220;They have fat legs and dimples, and Betty
sucks her thumb and has to be scolded, and
Billy shouts &#8216;More jam&#8217; and smudges it on
his knees.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you giving up your position?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, mercy, no. We have to live. Poor Jim
only left them insurance and nothing else,
and that did not last very long. I sent the
other aunt a small check every month to help
along and sort of heap coals of fire on her
head at the same time. No, I shall have to
work harder than ever now. But I get one
seventy-five a month now,&mdash;and lots of families
live on less.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Who will keep house then&mdash;Betty?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask silly questions, Eveley, I am so
nervous anyhow I hardly know what I am
saying. You remember my laundress, don&#8217;t
you? She is so nice and motherly and a Methodist
and respectable and all that,&mdash;only old
and hard up. She is coming to live with us,&mdash;she
will have the den for her room, and is
closing her cottage. She is to keep house and
look after the babies while I am at work.
She only charges twenty-five a month, so I
can manage. The rent does seem high, fifty
dollars,&mdash;but we need the room, though
you all thought it was so extravagant for me
to have such a large apartment to myself.
But you know how I am, Eveley,&mdash;I like lots
of space,&mdash;a place for everything, and everything
where it belongs. So I was willing to
stand the expense, and now it is a good thing
I did. Come and see the baby room.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley duly admired the blue Red-Riding-Hoods
and Jacks-and-Jills, exclaimed over the
tiny white beds, and tiny white tables and
chairs, and then said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;You seem to be enjoying this experience,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span>
so I suppose you do not feel it is your duty,
nor anything sordid like that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; laughed Eileen. &#8220;I am doing it because
I am just crazy about those babies, and
I am sort of lonely, Eveley, though I have
never realized it before. And when I think of
coming home to a frolic with fat little babies
in white dresses and blue ribbons,&mdash;well, I
am so happy I could fairly cry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Eveley put her arms around her, and
kissed her, and offered a few suggestions
about appropriate food for angel babies,&mdash;feeling
very wise from her recent experience
with Nathalie and Dan, and invited them all
to go driving with her on Saturday afternoon,
and mentally planned to send them an enormous
box of candy in the morning after their
arrival, and then said she must hurry back to
work.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you poor thing,&#8221; cried Eileen in contrition.
&#8220;You did not have any luncheon at all,
did you? Wait until I fix a sandwich and
you can slip into the dressing-room and eat it.
It will only take a minute. You may have
some of these animal cookies too,&mdash;I got a
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span>
dollar&#8217;s worth,&mdash;I knew the babies would love
them. Now, Eveley, won&#8217;t you come to dinner
to-morrow night and meet my little
blesseds? The train comes at six-ten, and
Mrs. Allis, I mean, Aunt Martha,&mdash;we have
decided to call her Aunt Martha,&mdash;will have
dinner all ready for us.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly I&#8217;ll come,&#8221; said Eveley promptly.
&#8220;I shall love it. And I&#8217;ll come for you in the
car and take you to the station.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After work that night, Eveley went into
the ten-cent store, and bought a startling
array of drums and horns and small shovels,
and sent them out to Eileen&#8217;s for the babies.
And that night she insisted that Nolan must
come to dinner with her to hear the great
good news.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is just because she wants to do it,&#8221; she
said happily. &#8220;That is why she is so full of
joy. It is plain selfishness,&mdash;she has no
thought of doing her Christian duty nor any
such nonsense. And&mdash;well, you would hardly
know Eileen. Her eyes are like stars, and her
voice runs up and down stairs in beautiful
trills, and she forgot to wear her hair net.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till Billy gets jam on her lace bedspread,
and Betty cuts up her new bonnet to
get the pretty flowers, and wait till they both
get mad and yowl at once,&mdash;she&#8217;ll be lucky if
she remembers her Christian duty then.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t he crabbish, Marie?&#8221; asked Eveley
plaintively. &#8220;He doesn&#8217;t like to see people
happy and thrilled and throbbing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, I do. I am thrilled and happy and
throbbing myself right now. There is something
about this Cote in the Clouds that&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And dear Eileen has lived alone so long,
poor thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can sympathize with her all right. I
have, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And now she will have a home, a real
home&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My own dream for years.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sweet companionship&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Heaven on earth, Eveley, heaven on
earth.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Something to live for&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Alas, how I envy her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolan, if you do not keep still and pay attention,
I shall stop talking and let you
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span>
propose,&mdash;right before Marie,&mdash;and then where
will you be?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Married, I hope.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Eveley decided there was no use to try
to talk sense with Nolan, but she arranged
to call for him at eight o&#8217;clock the next morning
to take him to Eileen&#8217;s and show him the
blue Red-Riding-Hoods and the toys.
</p>
<p>As she left the house to keep her engagement
with Nolan, she was surprised to see
Mrs. Severs starting out, for Mrs. Severs was
not used to being out so early.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, little Bride, whither away?&#8221; laughed
Eveley.
</p>
<p>Mrs. Severs flushed. &#8220;I am going to spend
the day with father,&#8221; she admitted, rather
shyly. &#8220;It is sort of lonesome here alone all
the time,&mdash;and we have lots of fun in the
little cottage on the hill. And sometimes we
go out on the beach and lie on the sand,&mdash;he
takes me in his jitney. He thinks I need more
sunshine and fresh air.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is great, isn&#8217;t he?&#8221; said Eveley
warmly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is dear,&#8221; cried Mrs. Severs, the quick
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
color surging her face. &#8220;I am not very well,
and he is so gentle and sweet to me. I&mdash;wish
I had been more patient,&mdash;I am very lonely
now. But we are great chums. He has taught
me to play pinochle, and I fill his pipe for him.
And onions aren&#8217;t so bad.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hum,&#8221; thought Eveley, as she drove
down-town. &#8220;You can&#8217;t suit some people, no
matter how finely you adjust their difficulties.&#8221;
Then she brightened. &#8220;Still, it is
better to love each other in two houses, than
to be bad friends in one,&mdash;as they were.&#8221;
</p>
<p>That evening, she and Eileen stood at the
station impatiently waiting,&mdash;having arrived
at five-thirty, fearing the train might come
ahead of time.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Eveley,&#8221; Eileen wailed. &#8220;Suppose they
should not like me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley laughed at that. &#8220;Suppose you do
not like them?&#8221; she parried.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do. I haven&#8217;t seen them for over
two years, but they are adorable. They are
seven now. The prettiest things,&mdash;long yellow
curls, and&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Billy will probably be shaved by this time,&mdash;I
mean barbered.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, never. No one would cut off curls like
his. Their hair will be longer I suppose, probably
darker,&mdash;and Betty lisps and swallows
while she is talking,&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she will be over that now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;In two years? Why, certainly not. They
will be just the same, only more so.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley began to experience a curious internal
sinking. Eileen was too deliriously optimistic
about those children. They were
angel babies, of course, for Eileen said so, but
Eveley remembered Nathalie and Dan,
angels, too,&mdash;but how they shouted and tore
through the house. And they were always
exhibiting fresh cuts and bruises, and Dan
had insisted on the confiscation of his curls
at four years. If Billy was still wearing curls
at seven, he needed a tonic for he was not
regular.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eileen,&#8221; she began very gently, &#8220;you&mdash;you
mustn&#8217;t expect too many dimples and
curls. Children are angels,&mdash;but they are
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
funny, too. They are always bleeding, you
know, and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Bleeding!&#8221; gasped Eileen. &#8220;Agnes never
mentioned bleeding! Do they always do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Always. They are always getting themselves
smashed and scratched, and blood runs
all over them, and gets matted in their hair,
and their hands are constitutionally dirty,
and&mdash;they always have at least one finger
totally and irrevocably smashed. Some times
it is two fingers, and once in a while a whole
hand, but the average is one finger.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eileen looked at her friend in a most professional
manner.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know if you are trying to be insulting,
or just amusing, but I saw those
children. I was right there for three weeks
only two years ago, and they were always
clean, they had curls, and they were certainly
not smashed or I should have noticed it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They shout, too, Eileen,&#8221; Eveley went on
wretchedly, determined to prepare Eileen for
the shock that was sure to follow. &#8220;They&mdash;they
just whoop. And&mdash;&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_238' name='page_238'></a>238</span></p>
<p>&#8220;If you can not be a little pleasanter, dear,
suppose you go and wait for me in the car. I
am too nervous. I simply can not stand it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not want to be unpleasant, and I shall
not say another word. I just wanted to remind
you of&mdash;of the shouting&mdash;and the
blood.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;One would think they were savages, Eveley,
instead of my own sister&#8217;s little babies.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Here comes the train,&#8221; cried Eveley, and
added in a soft whisper that Eileen could not
hear, &#8220;Oh, please, for Eileen&#8217;s sake, let &#8217;em
have dimples and curls, and don&#8217;t get &#8217;em
smashed before the train stops.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Hand in hand, with eager shining eyes, the
girls ran along the platform, and when the
porter put down his stool beneath the steps,
the first thing that appeared was a small
dimpled girl with golden curls, and a flower-like
face beneath a flower-laden bonnet.
</p>
<p>Eileen leaped upon her, catching her in her
arms, and in her rapturous delight, she did
not hear a small brusk voice exclaiming, &#8220;Oh,
pooh, I don&#8217;t need your old stool.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And she did not notice Eveley&#8217;s gasp,&mdash;for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
Eveley had seen a small sailor-clad form
hurtle itself from the step and fall flat upon
the gravel platform. It was not until a sudden
lusty roar went up that Eileen remembered
she had two babies en route. She
dropped Betty like a flash, and turned.
</p>
<p>The porter very grimly picked up the
child, and held him out, and Eileen saw with
horror that his face was fairly sandpapered
from the fall, and blood was starting from a
dozen tiny pricks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If this is yourn, for Gawd&#8217;s sake, take
&#8217;im,&#8221; begged the porter. &#8220;He&#8217;s fell off&#8217;n
everything and into everything between here
and Seattle.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eileen clung desperately to Betty&#8217;s moist
hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t get scared, Auntie,&#8221; chirped the
small bright voice. &#8220;Billy always falls into
things, and he ain&#8217;t never broke anything
yet,&mdash;himself, I mean, arms or legs or necks,&mdash;he
breaks lots of dishes and vases and
things like that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eileen was stricken dumb, but Eveley took
the writhing roaring boy from the porter&#8217;s
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
hand, and dusted him lightly with her handkerchief.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, where are your curls, Billy?&#8221; she
demanded, hoping to distract his attention.
And she succeeded only too well, for he
stopped so suddenly in the midst of a loud
wail that he almost choked. When he finally
recovered his breath, he snorted derisively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Curls! Huh! I ain&#8217;t no girl. I ain&#8217;t got
any curls. I never did have curls.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, you did,&#8221; she argued. &#8220;Two years
ago you had beautiful, long golden curls just
like Betty&#8217;s.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billy hunched up his shoulders and clenched
a small brown fist.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You got to say, &#8216;Excuse me for them
words,&#8217;&#8221; he said belligerently. &#8220;Ain&#8217;t so, and
you got to say it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Scenting battle, Eveley hastily muttered
the desired words, and passed him over to
Eileen.
</p>
<p>Billy thrust out a sturdy hand, but to
Eileen&#8217;s evident delight he refused to be
kissed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Betty&#8217;s got to be whipped, Aunt Eileen,&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
he announced. &#8220;Aunt Agnes told me to tell
you all she did on the train, and you would
whip her. She stuck a pin in a fat man that
was asleep,&mdash;that&#8217;s the man right there,&mdash;Say,
didn&#8217;t Betty stick a pin in you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But the fat man gave them a venomous
glare, and hurried away. &#8220;And she pulled the
beads off of that blonde lady&#8217;s coat,&mdash;and if
you don&#8217;t believe it, you can look in her
pocket &#8217;cause she&#8217;s got &#8217;em yet. And she
swiped a box of candy from that lady in the
yellow suit, and the lady said the porter did
it, and they had an awful fight. And she sang
<i>The Yanks Are Coming</i> in the middle of the
night and everybody swore something awful.
And she wouldn&#8217;t eat anything but ice-cream
at the table, and one meal she had five
dishes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley and Eileen had listened in fascinated
silence during this recital of his sister&#8217;s
wrongdoing. But Betty stuck a fat thumb
between rosy lips, and drooped her eyes demurely
behind her curling lashes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did&mdash;you do all that, Betty?&#8221; demanded
Eileen at last, very faintly.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I did more than that,&#8221; she said proudly.
&#8220;I put the pink lady&#8217;s bedroom slippers in a
man&#8217;s traveling bag, and they haven&#8217;t found
it out yet. And I slipped Billy&#8217;s wriggly lizard
down the black lady&#8217;s neck, and she said
a naughty word. And&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And what did Billy do?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty&#8217;s lips curled with scorn. &#8220;Billy? He
didn&#8217;t do anything. He&#8217;s too good. He don&#8217;t
ever do anything.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billy advanced with the threatening hunch
of his shoulders and clench of the brown fists.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say, &#8216;Excuse me for them words,&#8217;&#8221; he
said in a low voice. &#8220;And say it quick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty jerked her finger from her mouth
and mumbled rapidly in a voice of frightened
nervousness, &#8220;Excuse me for them words,
please excuse me for them words.&#8221; And then,
as her brother&#8217;s shoulders relaxed, she sidled
up to him, rubbing herself affectionately
against his arm, and whispered, &#8220;Aw, Billy,
I was only joking. You ain&#8217;t mad at me, are
you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go,&#8221; said Eileen. &#8220;I feel&mdash;faint.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sticking pins is good for faintness,&#8221; said
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span>
Betty hopefully. &#8220;I did it to Aunt Agnes
twice when she nearly fainted, and she came
to right away.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And she gave Betty a good whipping.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she did, and I only did it to cure her,&#8221;
said Betty in an aggrieved voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go fast,&#8221; begged Eileen. &#8220;Take your
handkerchief, Billy, and see if you can wipe
a little of the dirt and blood off your face.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He mustn&#8217;t do that,&#8221; interrupted Betty
promptly. &#8220;Handkerchiefs is full of germs,
and if he gets the germs in his scratches he
gets blood poison and dies. You got to wait
till you get home, Billy, and then lie on your
back on Aunt Eileen&#8217;s bed, and she&#8217;ll take
clean gauze and soak &#8217;em off in cold water.
If you haven&#8217;t got any gauze handy you can
use mine, but you&#8217;d better buy some. Billy
uses as much as a dollar&#8217;s worth of gauze in
no time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eileen put her hand over her face, and
turned away. The children followed, looking
about them in frank interest and pleasure.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that a palm tree?&#8221; asked Betty. &#8220;Billy
says God never made &#8217;em grow like that. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
says men just tie those fins on top to make
&#8217;em look funny. Did God do it, Aunt Eileen?
What did He do it for?&mdash;Oh, is this your
car, Aunt Eileen? Billy knows how to start
a car so you better not let him in it by himself.&#8221;
Then as the small boyish shoulders assumed
the dreadful hunch, she cried excitedly,
&#8220;Oh, no, he can&#8217;t either, honest he can&#8217;t.
He doesn&#8217;t know what to turn, nor anything.
I was joking. You ain&#8217;t mad at me, are you,
Billy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley slipped silently into her place behind
the wheel, and Billy opened the door for
his aunt and sister, banged it smartly after
their entrance, and climbed in front with
Eveley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They oughtn&#8217;t to let women drive cars,&#8221;
he said in a judicial tone. &#8220;Women is too
nervous. There ought to be a law against it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley laughed. &#8220;I think so, too,&#8221; she
agreed pleasantly. &#8220;But until there is such a
law, I think I shall keep on driving.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billy stared at her suspiciously. &#8220;You don&#8217;t
need to agree with me to be polite,&#8221; he said.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span>
&#8220;It won&#8217;t hurt my feelings any. I ain&#8217;t used
to it, anyhow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Betty, in the rear seat, cuddled cozily
against her rigid aunt and kept up a constant
flow of conversation in her pretty chirpy
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you an old maid? Aunt Agnes said
you were. Did you do it on purpose, or
couldn&#8217;t you help yourself? I am not going
to be an old maid. I am engaged now. Billy
tried to be engaged, too, but Freckle Harvey
cut him out.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Billy suddenly squared about in his seat,
and Betty shivered into a small and terrified
heap. &#8220;Aw, no, he didn&#8217;t either. Billy didn&#8217;t
like her worth a cent. He thinks she is just
hideous, don&#8217;t you, Billy? You ain&#8217;t mad at
me, are you, Billy?&#8221;
</p>
<p>When Eveley drew the car up before the
big apartment-house on Sixth Street, Billy
forgot his temporary burst of manners. With
a hoarse shout he slid deftly over the door
and dashed up the steps. Shrieking gleefully,
Betty followed swiftly in his wake.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Eveley,&#8221; faltered Eileen, &#8220;I am afraid
they scratched the car.&#8221; She got out hastily,
and caught her lips between her teeth as she
saw the long jagged scratch on the door
where Betty&#8217;s sharp heel had passed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Eveley bravely. &#8220;It
doesn&#8217;t make a bit of difference. We all know
how children are.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&mdash;I didn&#8217;t,&#8221; said Eileen weakly. &#8220;I&mdash;guess
I am an old maid. I hadn&#8217;t realized it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In Betty&#8217;s extravagant delight over the
new room, and Billy&#8217;s quiet but equally sincere
pleasure, something of Eileen&#8217;s own enthusiasm
returned, and although her ministrations
upon Billy&#8217;s marred countenance,
performed under the critical and painstaking
eye of Sister Betty, left her weak-kneed and
pale, she took her place at the table with
something very much akin to pleasure, if it
were not the jubilant delight she had anticipated.
</p>
<p>Eveley went home immediately after dinner,
stopping on her way for Nolan. They
spent an uproarious hour over her account of
the twins and their reception. And at last,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span>
weak with laughter, Eveley wiped her eyes,
and said with deep sympathy:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Eileen! And the twins are adorable.
But I believe one needs to be born with children
and grow up with them gradually. For
when they spring upon you full grown they
are&mdash;well, they are certainly a shock.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>MARIE ENCOUNTERS THE SECRET SERVICE</h3>
</div>

<p>In the beginning Eveley had hesitated to
leave her newly adopted sister alone in the
Cloud Cote in the evening, but as Marie
seemed absolutely to know no fear, and as
time did not hang at all heavily upon her
hands, Eveley was soon running about among
her friends as she had always done. But with
this change: there was always a light in the
window at the top of the rustic stairs when
she came home, and a warm and tender welcome
awaiting her.
</p>
<p>Marie had come to be charmingly useful
in the Cloud Cote. She prepared breakfast
while Eveley dressed, and did the light bit of
housework nicely and without effort. Eveley
usually had her luncheon down-town, but in
the evening dinner was well started before
she reached home. Her mending was always
exquisitely done, even before she knew that
mending was necessary, and among her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
lingerie she often came upon fine bits of lace
she had not seen before.
</p>
<p>After long and loving persuasion, Marie
had consented to meet Eveley&#8217;s sister and
brother-in-law, and Eveley had them in for
dinner. Marie was quiet that night, scarcely
speaking except now and then to the babies.
The next week, however, when Winifred
asked both girls to dinner, Marie went without
argument, and seemed to take a great
deal of quiet satisfaction in the visit.
</p>
<p>Kitty and Eileen she met often in the Cloud
Cote, but always withdrew as quickly as possible
to her own room to leave Eveley alone
with her friends. With Nolan, Eveley openly
insisted that Marie should develop a friendship.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why, he will very likely be my husband
one of these days, when he gets around to it,&#8221;
she explained frankly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Your husband,&#8221; echoed Marie. &#8220;I thought
Mr. Hiltze&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no,&#8221; denied Eveley, flushing a little.
&#8220;He is just a pleasant in-between-whiles. We
are fellow-Americanizers, that is all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Does Mr. Hiltze know that?&#8221; queried
Marie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, everybody knows that I belong to
Nolan when the time comes,&#8221; said Eveley,
laughing.
</p>
<p>Nolan, urgently warned by Eveley, met
Marie with friendly ease and asked no questions.
He took her hand cordially and said
in his pleasant voice. &#8220;Well, if you are Eveley&#8217;s
sister, I have a half-way claim upon you
myself, and you must count me in.&#8221; And then
he promptly began mashing potatoes for
their dinner, and Marie did not mind him at
all.
</p>
<p>When Amos Hiltze came to the Cloud Cote
she joined serenely with them, very easy and
comfortable, always careful to go to her room
before he left, that he might have a little
while alone with Eveley. For she saw plainly
that while he interested Eveley only in his
enthusiasm for Americanization, for him
Eveley had a deeper and sweeter charm.
</p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon when Nolan was
busy, the two girls went out for a picnic on
the beach, a well-filled basket in the car for
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
their dinner. On a sudden impulse, Eveley
turned to Marie and cried:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, little sister, how would you like to
learn to drive? Then you can take me to
the office and have the car yourself to play
with while I am busy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eveley,&#8221; came the ecstatic gasp, &#8220;would
you&mdash;let me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Would I let you?&#8221; laughed Eveley.
&#8220;Should you like it? Why, you have been
wanting to, haven&#8217;t you? Why didn&#8217;t you ask
me, Marie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I couldn&#8217;t.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you should have,&#8221; said Eveley gravely.
&#8220;I would have told you honestly if I did
not wish it. I said you must feel free to ask
me for anything, didn&#8217;t I. And don&#8217;t I always
mean what I say&mdash;to you, at least?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Does your love for Americanization carry
you so far?&#8221; asked Marie curiously.
</p>
<p>Eveley was silent a moment. &#8220;I can not
exactly count you Americanization,&#8221; she said
honestly. &#8220;I do not believe Americanizing you
could add anything to your sweetness, anyhow.
You are just fun, and&mdash;You may not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
believe it, Marie,&#8221; she added rather shyly,
for she was not a demonstrative girl, &#8220;but I&mdash;really
I love you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Quick tears leaped to Marie&#8217;s dark eyes,
and she placed her head softly against Eveley&#8217;s
shoulder, though she did not speak. Almost
instantly Eveley brushed away the
wave of sentiment and gave her quick bright
laugh.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now listen, sweetness,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It is
like this. This is the clutch that controls the
gears. When it wabbles like this it is in
neutral and the car will not run. When you
shove down with your left foot, and pull the
clutch to the left and backward, it is in low
gear, and the car will go forward when you
let your foot back. You must do it very
slowly, so there will be no pull nor jerk.
Like this.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So the afternoon wore away, the two girls
laughing gaily as Marie made her first
bungling attempts to drive; but later, Marie
was aglow with exultation and Eveley with
deep pride, because the little foreigner
showed real aptitude for handling the car.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></p>
<p>Then in a lovely quiet part of the beach a
little beyond La Jolla, they had an early supper
and drove home, Eveley at the wheel,
singing love songs, Marie humming softly
with her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is almost like sweethearting, isn&#8217;t
it?&#8221; asked Eveley turning to look into the
dark eyes fixed adoringly upon her. &#8220;Next to
Nolan you satisfy me more than anything
else in the world. But don&#8217;t tell Nolan. He
is jealous of you,&mdash;he thinks I like you better
than I do him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You say you love me, Eveley. But do you?
Is it the kind of love that can understand and
sympathize and forgive&mdash;yes, and keep on
loving even when&mdash;things are wrong?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing could change my feeling for you,
Marie,&#8221; said Eveley positively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But if things were wrong?&#8221; came the insistent
query.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I am no angel myself,&#8221; answered
Eveley, laughing again. &#8220;If you are a
naughty girl, I shall say, &#8216;I will forgive you
if you will forgive me,&#8217; and there you are.&#8221;
She stopped again, to laugh. &#8220;But I can&#8217;t
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
think of any wrong you could do, Marie. You
just naturally do not associate with wrong
things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will always remember, won&#8217;t you,
what you have said about love of one&#8217;s country?
That it excuses and glorifies everything
in the world?&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Eveley was singing again.
</p>
<p>Eveley had made an arrangement to call
for Nolan at the office at eight, as they were
going to Kitty&#8217;s for a late supper with her
and Arnold Bender, so she kissed Marie good
night when they reached home, and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you be lonesome without your big
sister, and boss?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I shall go down and watch the
dark shadows in your beautiful canyon,&#8221; said
Marie, clinging to Eveley&#8217;s hand, and looking
deeply into her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you afraid down there at night?&#8221;
wondered Eveley. &#8220;I have lived on top of the
canyon all my life, and we played hide-and-seek
there when we were children, and I love
it,&mdash;and yet when night comes, I do not even
go so far as the rose pergola unless Nolan is
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
there to hold my hand and shoo away the
ghosts and things.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is our difference. You are afraid of
the world and the night, I am afraid only of
men and women. I have lived alone, and have
had wide dark gardens to wander in. They
have never harmed me. Only men have
injured me, and my family. So I love to slip
down into the soft fragrant darkness of the
canyon and sit on the big stones or on the
velvet grass, and see my future in the
shadows.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But do not stay long. The whole canyon
is yours to dream in, if it makes you happy.
But wear a heavy wrap and do not get
chilled.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then with a hasty kiss she ran down the
steps to the car.
</p>
<p>Eveley was tired that night. The first lesson
in driving, the lazy supper on the beach,
and the long ride, left her listless and indolent.
So after their merry dinner, and a dance
or two around the Victrola, she said she had
a headache and wanted to go home.
</p>
<p>They drove very slowly along the winding
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_256' name='page_256'></a>256</span>
road, and were quietly content. Nolan opened
the doors of the garage and Eveley ran the
car into place; then, as she was really tired,
at the foot of the rustic stairs he said good
night, while she crept slowly up the steps.
</p>
<p>For the first time, there was no Marie to
welcome her. The room, though lighted,
looked dreary and forlorn without the pretty
adopted girl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The little goosie,&#8221; said Eveley, with a tender
smile. &#8220;I suppose she is still dreaming
down in that spooky canyon. Maybe she has
fallen asleep. I shall have to go after her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She took a small flash-light, and hurried
down the rustic stairs and the well-known
path beyond the rose pergola, where she
hoped to find Marie.
</p>
<p>But Marie was not there.
</p>
<p>Eveley knew every foot of the canyon by
heart; she went surely and without hesitation
along the twisting, winding, rocky path,
half-way down the narrow slope.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie,&#8221; she called softly, &#8220;Marie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But there was no answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she is behind the live oak in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
Rambler&#8217;s Retreat,&#8221; she thought, and climbed
up the steep bank from the path, clinging to
bits of shrubbery and foliage. But Marie was
not there. And then as Eveley turned, she
heard quick running steps in the pathway
under the swinging bridge that spanned the
canyon lower down.
</p>
<p>Eveley sighed aloud in her relief,&mdash;then
her breath caught in her throat,&mdash;a gasp of
fear.
</p>
<p>For sounding clear and distinct above the
light steps came a pounding of heavier feet.
Some one was following Marie up the path,&mdash;no,
there were two for there was another
pounding a little fainter, farther away. Now
Eveley could hear the frightened intake of
Marie&#8217;s breath as she ran. Two girls alone
in the dark canyon.
</p>
<p>Eveley clung desperately to the heavy
shrubbery among which she was crouching.
She was about three feet above the path on
the steep bank. Clinging for support with
one hand, she reached noiselessly about for a
stone, but there was nothing upon which she
could lay her hand.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span></p>
<p>Below the path, the canyon dropped
sharply for a long way, fifty or sixty feet
perhaps, not a precipice, but with a decided
drop that could only be descended with care.
If Marie would only lie down and roll, she
might be able to hide among the bushes at
the bottom. But Marie did not think of that.
Her one idea was to run faster and faster, in
the hope of escaping her pursuers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie,&#8221; whispered Eveley sharply as the
girl came up the path near her, and Marie,
hearing the faint sound, stopped suddenly in
her tracks, swaying, more frightened than
ever.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lie down, lie down,&#8221; urged Eveley, but
Marie did not hear, and before she could
gather her wits to run on, a man leaped toward
her, both arms outstretched.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I got you,&#8221; he panted.
</p>
<p>Marie, following the terrified instinct of
every hunted animal, swung her lithe body
and ducked beneath his arm. And at that
moment, Eveley, tightening her hold upon
the branches of the bush, drew up her
feet, braced herself against the bank for
a moment, and then sprang heavily against
the man with both feet and sent him reeling
head-first down the canyon.
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-257.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;Marie,&#8221; whispered Eveley sharply.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span></div>
<p>Like a flash, Marie flattened herself against
the bank&mdash;one more dark shadow among the
others&mdash;and none too soon, for the second
man was close upon them, so close they could
hear the heavy rasp of his breathing. Eveley
had not time to raise herself for another
spring, so she crouched against the bank in
terror, hoping in his haste that he might pass
them by. But as he came near he paused
suddenly, his attention attracted by the sound
of tearing brush, and the incoherent cries of
his companion as he rolled down the canyon.
Taking it as an indication that the chase was
in that direction, he turned blindly to follow,
and not knowing the lay of the land, lost his
footing at once and fell headlong.
</p>
<p>Eveley was upon her feet in an instant.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Run, Marie,&#8221; she whispered, and in less
than a moment they were hurrying up the
path behind the rose pergola under the magnolias
and beneath the light from their Cloud
Cote.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Wait,&#8221; whispered Marie. &#8220;Let&#8217;s hide a
moment. They might see us going up the
stairs. Wait beneath the roses until they are
gone.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Only faint sounds came up to them as the
two men, bruised and sore, painfully picked
themselves up from the rocks and the prickly
shrubs. Evidently they realized there was
no hope of further pursuit, for in a short
while the girls could hear the faint echo of
their heavy footsteps as they retraced their
way down the canyon.
</p>
<p>Eveley held Marie in her arms until the
last sound had echoed away, and then silently
they climbed the stairs, crossed the little garden
on the roof, and crawled through the
window into the safety of the Cote.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you hurt, Marie?&#8221; asked Eveley, the
first to break the tense silence that fell upon
them when they were conscious of shelter
and security.
</p>
<p>Marie shook her head. Then she moved
one step toward Eveley, and asked in a pleading
whisper: &#8220;Are you angry with me? Do
you hate me?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_261' name='page_261'></a>261</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Marie, don&#8217;t talk so,&#8221; cried Eveley,
nervous tears springing to her eyes. &#8220;How
could I be angry with you? But I was so
frightened and shocked. I did not know how
very much I loved you. You must never go
into the canyon again at night. Never once,&mdash;for
one minute. Will you promise me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will promise whatever you wish, Eveley,
you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley smiled at her weakly, and turning
to take off her wraps saw with surprise that
the sleeves were torn almost from her coat.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I must have come down with quite a
bang,&#8221; she said faintly, suddenly aware that
her shoulders were quivering with pain.
</p>
<p>With a little cry of pity, Marie ran to her,
and tenderly helped to remove her blouse.
The tears ran down her face when she saw
the red and swollen shoulders beneath.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my poor angel,&#8221; she mourned. &#8220;All
bruised and sore like that. For me. You
never should have done it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Very sweetly she bathed the shoulders,
and when Eveley crept painfully into bed, she
arranged soft compresses of cotton and oil
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
for her to lie upon. And she asked, shyly, if
she might sit by the bed.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Until you fall asleep,&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;I can
not leave you like this, when you are in such
pain,&mdash;for me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come and sleep with me, then,&#8221; said Eveley.
&#8220;I do not want to let you go off alone,
either, when&mdash;something so terrible might
have happened to you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eagerly and with great joy Marie availed
herself of the privilege, and slipped into her
place beside Eveley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you suffer in the night, please ask me
to help you,&#8221; she begged. &#8220;I will not sleep,
but I do not wish to speak until I know you
are awake.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must sleep,&#8221; said Eveley.
</p>
<p>But Marie did not sleep. Sometimes Eveley
would moan a little, turning heavily, and
then, without a sound, Marie was out of bed,
replacing the bandages with fresh ones,
crooning softly over Eveley as a mother over
a suffering child.
</p>
<p>Fortunately the next day was Sunday, and
Eveley remained quietly on a couch, with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
Marie waiting upon her like a tender Madonna.
Nolan came up, too, and insisted upon
the full story of what had happened.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I fell,&#8221; said Eveley positively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You did not fall on your shoulder-blades,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;You girls have been up to some
monkey business, and I want to know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>After long insistence, Eveley told him of
the night&#8217;s adventure, Marie sitting erect and
rigid during the recital.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Where did you go, Marie?&#8221; he asked, in
deep concern.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I went too far,&#8221; she confessed regretfully.
&#8220;But it was an exquisite night, and I was
happy. I went down farther and farther, and
did not realize it. Suddenly I looked up, and
knew I was far, far down. I turned at once.&mdash;Then
some one called. A man&#8217;s voice. I
ran, and the steps came pounding after me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You must not go into the canyon at night
again, please, Marie. You are too young.
And&mdash;the canyon goes away down to the
water-front where there are a lot of Greasers
and&mdash;I mean, half-breeds,&#8221; he stammered
quickly, &#8220;all kinds of foreigners along the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span>
road down there! You must stay on top of
your canyon and be good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The next morning, although Eveley knew
her arms were too stiff and sore for work,
she decided to go to the office anyhow to see
the day well started.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They will send me home, and I shall be
here for luncheon with you. I can not drive
yet, so I&#8217;ll just cross the bridge and go on the
street-car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>As she stood on the swinging bridge, looking
down into the lovely canyon, it seemed
impossible that there in the friendly shadows
such horrible dangers had menaced them. Of
a sudden impulse, she ran back, and climbed
carefully down to where she had clung so
grimly to the tangled vines and had knocked
Marie&#8217;s assailant from the path.
</p>
<p>No, it was no dream. The vines were torn
and mangled and on the path were the marks
of trampling feet, and peering down the canyon
she could discern two distinct trails
where the men had tumbled and reeled. She
slowly followed the trails, picking her way
carefully, clinging to bits of shrub. Her lips
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
curved into a grim smile as she pictured their
surprise and pain. At the foot of the canyon
she saw something shining among the rocks.
</p>
<p>She lifted it curiously, and turned it in her
hand. It was clean and shining,&mdash;a small
steel badge marked Secret Service.
</p>
<p>Eveley&#8217;s eyes clouded, and her brows took
on a troubled frown, as she put the badge
carefully into her purse.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall never tell Marie,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It
would not help much with the Americanization
of a sweet and trusting foreign girl to
know she had been followed at night by a
steel badge marked Secret Service.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Eveley followed the path back to the
bridge again with a grieved and troubled air.

<p>As the weeks passed, Eveley noticed a
change in the conduct of the honeymoon
home beneath her. Many times in the
early morning, she saw Mrs. Severs going out
with a covered basket and wearing an old long
coat and a tight-fitting small hat. And sometimes
she met her in the evening, coming
home, dusty, tired and happy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going to father&#8217;s,&#8221; she would explain
lightly. Or, &#8220;I have been out with father
to-day.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And at the quizzical laughter in Eveley&#8217;s
eyes, she would add defiantly: &#8220;He is a darling,
Eveley, and I was very silly. Why didn&#8217;t
you bring me to my senses?&#8221;
</p>
<p>For Mrs. Severs was feeling less well than
usual, and in the long absence of her husband
every day, she was learning to depend
on the brusk, kindly, capable father-in-law.
And many days, when she was not well
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
enough to leave home, he came himself, and
the girls up-stairs could hear him in the kitchen
below, preparing dinner for Andy and
his ailing bride.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Whatever should I do without him, Miss
Ainsworth?&#8221; she sometimes asked. &#8220;He does
everything for me. And I think he likes me
pretty well, now he is getting used to me.
He is good to me,&mdash;his little funny ways are
not really funny any more, but rather sweet.
I spoiled everything with my selfishness, and
he will never try to live with us again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One evening, when Father-in-law had been
particularly tender and helpful, she looked at
Eveley with brooding eyes, and said, &#8220;You
are such a nice girl, but I sort of blame you
because father is not with us. You are so
much cleverer than I,&mdash;couldn&#8217;t you have
opened my eyes before it was too late?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Eveley ran up the stairs shaking her
slender fists in the air. &#8220;Deliver me from
brides,&#8221; she said devoutly to the rose in the
corner of her roof garden. &#8220;Grooms are bad
enough, but brides are utterly impossible. I
would not live with one for anything on earth.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
To think of the wretched life they were living
until I helped them to a proper adjustment,&mdash;and
now she holds me responsible. I
always said Father-in-law was the most desirable
member of the family.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But even he disappointed her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, are you getting enough freedom?&#8221;
she asked him pleasantly one evening as she
met him coming in.
</p>
<p>He looked about cautiously before he answered.
&#8220;Excuse me, miss,&#8221; he said apologetically,
&#8220;but you are away off on some
things. Freedom is all right, but a little of it
goes a long ways. Sometimes folks like company.
She,&#8221; he said, with an explanatory
wave of his thumb toward the house, &#8220;she is
a pretty fair sort. I&#8217;ve got so danged sick of
having my own way that, Holy Mackinaw,
I&#8217;d try living with an orphan asylum for a
change. You see, I was just getting used to
her, and so I kind of miss her cluttering
around under foot.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley was quite annoyed at this turn of
events, and her feeling of perturbation lasted
fully half-way up the rustic stairs. But by
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
the time she had crossed the roof garden and
swung through the window she was herself
again. She caught Marie about the shoulders
and danced her through the room with a
spinning whirl.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Such a lark,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;The most fun we
are going to have. Listen, sweetest thing in
the world, we are going to have a party to-night,
you and I, and Nolan and Jimmy Ames.
They are coming here, Jimmy for you of
course, for I always get Nolan if he is in the
party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Eveley,&#8221; gasped Marie, paling a little.
&#8220;I can&#8217;t. I&mdash;Mr. Hiltze said I should not meet
men, you know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, he is not the head of our family.
And besides, he will not know a thing about
this. You will love Jimmy Ames. I nearly do
myself. He is so big and blond and boyish,&mdash;you
know, the slow, good, lovey kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;ll ask&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I know Jimmy Ames. After
one look at you, he will not be able to ask
questions for a month. Come, let&#8217;s hurry.
You must wear that exquisite little yellow
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_270' name='page_270'></a>270</span>
thing, and I&#8217;ll wear black to bring you out
nicely.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Eveley, you mustn&#8217;t&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Nolan likes me in black, anyhow. He
says it makes me look heavenly, and of course
one ought to sustain an illusion like that if
possible. Now do not argue, Marie. We are
going to have a perfectly wonderful time, and
you will be as happy as a lark.&#8221;
</p>
<p>For a moment longer Marie hesitated,
frowning into space. Then she suddenly
brightened, and a wistful eagerness came into
her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eveley, I am going to do whatever you
tell me. If you wish me to be of your party,
I will. And if you say, &#8216;Do not tell Mr. Hiltze,&#8217;
I shall never tell him. And if you say, &#8216;Like
Mr. Ames,&#8217; I shall adore him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a nice girl,&#8221; cried Eveley, happily
whirling into her chair at the table and dropping
her hat upon the floor at her side. &#8220;I
couldn&#8217;t have planned anything nicer than
this. Kitty and Arnold often have parties
with us, but it will be much better having
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
you and Jimmy. He looks very smart in his
uniform.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Uniform,&#8221; faltered Marie suddenly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;Lieutenant Ames, you know,&mdash;Jimmy
Ames.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant? Oh, Eveley, please, let&#8217;s not.
I&mdash;am not fond of the military. I am afraid
of soldiers. Let me&mdash;Have some one else
dear, please. Get Kitty this time, won&#8217;t you?
I am afraid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait till you see Jimmy. He isn&#8217;t the
snoopy overbearing kind that you are used
to. Can&#8217;t you trust me yet, Marie? I wouldn&#8217;t
have you meet any one who would be unpleasant
or suspicious. You have found the rest
of my friends all right, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, never mind,&#8221; Marie decided suddenly.
&#8220;I will come to the party, but do not ever
let Mr. Hiltze know, will you? He would be
raging.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie, do you love Amos Hiltze?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Love him! I hate him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Hate him? Then why in the world are you
so afraid of him? You obey every word he
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span>
says, and follow every suggestion he makes.
I thought you were great friends.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Marie flushed and paled swiftly. &#8220;It is because
I am grateful to him,&#8221; she said at last,
not meeting Eveley&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;He brought me
to you,&mdash;and he helps me,&mdash;and I am, willing
to do whatever he tells me except when you
wish something else. But I do not like him
personally by any means, and I wish he did
not come here so much.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought you were friends,&#8221; Eveley repeated
confusedly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is in love with you&mdash;don&#8217;t you know
that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&mdash;perhaps so. But Angelo says men
can love two women simultaneously. Angelo
says there is something strange about his
bringing&mdash;I mean,&#8221; she interrupted herself
quickly, &#8220;Angelo wondered where he found
you, or&mdash;or something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Angelo is a good friend to you, Eveley.
You might pay better heed to his suggestions,
to your own good,&#8221; said Marie faintly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I thought,&mdash;oh, I do not know what I
thought. Well, we can shunt Mr. Hiltze off
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span>
a little, if you wish. But you should not dislike
him. He is greatly interested in you, and
so full of enthusiasm and eagerness for this
Americanization idea. He has been a great
help to me, and he is very clever. And since
he brought us together we should love him a
little. Any one who struggles with Americanization
deserves my patriotic and sympathetic
interest, at least.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221; And she added slowly: &#8220;One
can show enthusiasm for the things one hates
worst in the world,&mdash;if there is a secret reason.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not mean Mr. Hiltze, do you?&#8221;
asked Eveley, with quiet loyalty.
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, to be sure not. I only said one could.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hiltze is nothing to us. Toss him
away. Come now, let&#8217;s doll up for our party.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were two radiantly lovely girls who
stood in the little garden on the roof of the
sun parlor, waiting for the men who ran up
the wavering rustic stairs to join them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, girls,&#8221; cried Nolan plaintively, as he
saw them in their beauty. &#8220;It is not fair of
you to look like this. Marie, you are exquisite.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
Eveley, you ought to be ashamed of
yourself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, we are,&#8221; said Eveley pleasantly.
&#8220;Jimmy, I want you to meet my darling and
adorable little friend, Marie Ledesma. This is
Lieutenant Ames, Marie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Lieutenant Ames stood very tall and slim
and straight as he looked into Marie&#8217;s face.
Then he saw the soft appeal in her eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Be good to me,&#8221; they seemed to beg, &#8220;be
generous, and kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was in answer to this plea of the limpid
eyes that he held out his hand with sudden
impulse, and said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miss Ledesma, when Eveley speaks like
that, I know your friendship is a priceless
boon, and I want my share of it. I am receiving
a sort of psychic message that you and I
are destined to be good comrades.&#8221;
</p>
<p>A sudden wave of light swept over her
lovely face, and her lips parted in a happy
smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Lieutenant Ames,&#8221; she whispered in her
soft voice, &#8220;do you really feel so? And then
you also are my friend?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Jimmy Ames, you stop that,&#8221; cried Eveley.
&#8220;Marie belongs to me, and you must not
even try to supplant me. I won&#8217;t have it.
Come on in, everybody, and let&#8217;s play, play,
play to our heart&#8217;s content.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Marie went through the window first, with
a light slender swing of her feet. But Eveley,
as always plunging impulsively, lost her
balance and fell among the cushions. Nolan
and the lieutenant followed laughing.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must take a day off and teach Eveley
the approved method of making entrance to a
social gathering,&#8221; said Nolan. &#8220;Are you all
black and blue, you poor child?&#8221; he asked,
helping her up, for she had waited patiently
for his assistance.
</p>
<p>It was a wonderfully happy party. They
played the Victrola, and danced merrily
through the two rooms, around the reading
table, through the archway, winding among
the chairs in the dining-room. When they
were tired, Marie brought her mandolin,&mdash;for
having remarked once idly that she could
play it, Eveley that night had brought her
one as a little gift of love. And she played
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span>
soft Spanish love-songs, singing in her pretty
lilting voice. Then altogether they prepared
their supper and because the night was still
young and lovely, and they were happy and
free from pressing care, they decided suddenly
for a drive. They crossed the bay on the
ferry to Coronado, and went down on the
sands of the beach for a while, standing
quietly to watch the silver tips of the waves
shining in the pale moonlight. Then they
drove out the Silver Strand and so home once
more.
</p>
<p>Before they parted, they arranged for another
party, two nights later, and after long
discussion agreed that it should be an evening
swimming party in the bay at Coronado,
with a hot supper afterward in the Cloud
Cote.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you like our Lieutenant Jimmy?&#8221;
Eveley demanded, as soon as they were alone.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is incomparable,&#8221; said Marie simply.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I knew it,&#8221; cried Eveley ecstatically.
&#8220;Nolan and I both said so. Spontaneous combustion,
that is what it was. Come and sleep
with me again to-night. It is such fun to go
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span>
to bed and turn out the light and talk. Did
you ever do it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, my life has not been of that kind.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will learn. I never saw any one
learn as quickly as you do,&mdash;especially things
about men.&mdash;Now I shall begin by telling you
how adorable Nolan is, and you must interrupt
me to say how wonderful Jimmy is.&mdash;Did
you ever have a sweetheart, Marie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she added quickly: &#8220;Wait, wait. I&mdash;I
did not mean to ask questions,&mdash;Excuse me,
I am sorry. Let&#8217;s talk of something else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, let&#8217;s talk of lovers,&#8221; said Marie,
snuggling close to Eveley, her head lying
against her shoulder. &#8220;I have never had the
regular kind of a lover,&mdash;your kind,&mdash;the
kind that women want. My life was full of
war and horrors, and I had not time for the
thrills of love. And the men I knew were not
the men that one would wish to love one.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, this is your chance,&#8221; said Eveley
happily. &#8220;Now I am positively sure that one
of these days you will be a matchless American
woman. You are just ripe and ready for
love. You can&#8217;t escape it, you sweet thing,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span>
even if you could wish. War and horrors
were left behind in your old home. Here in
your new home you will know only peace and
contentment and love. Aren&#8217;t you glad I
adopted you? We must give Mr. Hiltze credit
for that anyhow, mustn&#8217;t we?&#8221;
</p>
<p>There was a sudden tension in the slender
figure at her side. &#8220;Eveley, are you so innocent?
Do you never attribute evil motives
to any one? Do you always believe only good
and beautiful and lovely things of those you
meet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I have no real reason for thinking
mean or ugly things of any one&mdash;not really.
I never had any horrors in my life until the
war came. I have just lived along serenely
and contentedly, and being fairly nice and
kind, I have no guilty conscience to trouble
me, and no one has ever been hateful or mean
to me&mdash;not in anything that really counted.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Both were silent a moment, thinking, each
in her different way, of the contrast in their
lives. Then Eveley went on, more slowly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel sometimes that we are living on the
crest of a terrible upheaval&mdash;that we are on
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_279' name='page_279'></a>279</span>
the edge of a seething volcano which is
threatening and rumbling beneath us, each
day growing fiercer and more ominous, and
that presently may come chaos, and we on the
crater of life will be dragged down into the
furnace with the rest. I suppose,&#8221; she added
apologetically, &#8220;it is because of the conditions
that always follow a war, the political unrest,
the social chaos, the anarchistic tendencies
of every one. I am not in the midst of things
enough to understand them, but even up here
on the top of our canyon, we sometimes get
a blast of the hot air from below, and it
troubles us. Then we try to forget, and go
on with our playing. But the volcano still
rumbles beneath.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley slipped her hand out to take Marie&#8217;s
and found it icy cold.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did&mdash;did you ever feel so before?&#8221; asked
Marie in a low strange voice. &#8220;That you
were living on the rim of a volcano, ready to
catch and crush you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not before. It is just now&mdash;after the
war. Conditions were never the same before.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span></p>
<p>Then Marie burst into a passion of tears.
&#8220;It is my fault,&#8221; she sobbed. &#8220;It is because
I am here. All my life I have lived in the
crater of a volcano, and I have brought it
upon you. It is a curse I carry with me. It
is the chaos from which I have come, and to
which I must go again when I leave you&mdash;it
is that which destroys your peace.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Frightened and astonished, Eveley soothed
her, cradling her in her arms. &#8220;You little
silly,&#8221; she said tenderly. &#8220;You dear little
goose. Don&#8217;t you believe any such nonsense
as that. We are in a condition of turmoil,
our United States and all the rest of the
world. It is not the affairs of your Mexico
that worry me&mdash;it is the tempest in my own
country. And don&#8217;t you ever talk any more
about going back. You shall never go back.
You are to stay here with me forever and
ever, world without end, amen. You will,
won&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Marie only stirred a little, and did not answer.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie,&#8221; cried Eveley, her voice sharp with
fear. &#8220;Do you ever think really of going back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
to&mdash;that? Answer me.&#8221; And she gripped
Marie&#8217;s soft shoulder with strong fingers.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not think any more,&#8221; said Marie gently.
&#8220;But one always has a feeling that one
must return whence one has come, do you not
think? It is only that. It seems incredible
that I, alone out of our struggling thousands,
should be let to come away and live serenely
in a cloud cote, does it not? And the struggle
in Mexico goes on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The same kind of peace and contentment
will come to all your country when the world
is settled down to law and order once more,&#8221;
said Eveley, with the sublime faith of the
young and the unsuffering. &#8220;It just takes
time. And God was good enough to carry
you away before the end of the conflict. Just
wait. When our country is thoroughly Americanized,
and returns to joyful work and love
and life again, the contagion will spread to
your people, and peace will reign there also.
So do not talk any more nonsense about leaving
me. Now let&#8217;s go back to the beginning,
and talk about&mdash;the men.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>CONVERTS OF LOVE</h3>
</div>

<p>A very warm intimacy developed rapidly
between the four friends, and every
evening for nearly two weeks found them
joyfully, even riotously, making merry together
in the Cloud Cote. As Eveley had
prophesied, Lieutenant Ames was hopelessly
lost from the first, and Marie yielded herself
very readily to the charm of an ardent
wooing.
</p>
<p>But with Eveley, Marie was different, more
quiet, less demonstrative, sometimes plainly
listless and absent-minded. Eveley ascribed
the change to her newly developed interest in
Lieutenant Ames, and patiently awaited the
outcome of the ripening romance. For Eveley
had a deep-seated sympathy with every appeal
of love.
</p>
<p>For many weeks she had received no word
from Miriam Landis. Although she had
passed in an hour from all connection with
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
their daily plans, yet she was never far from
their thought. Even without their tender
and sympathetic memories, they could not
have forgotten her, for her husband was a
frequent and always tumultuous visitor in the
Cote.
</p>
<p>He invariably began talking before he was
through the window, and his first words
were unfailingly the same.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t stand it, Eveley, I simply can&#8217;t
stand it. You&#8217;ve got to do something
about it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Again and again he came with this appeal,
always overlooking the fact that Eveley had
no faintest idea of Miriam&#8217;s whereabouts,
for, true to her word, she had kept her hiding-place
unknown to them all.
</p>
<p>Then for several weeks he did not come,
and Eveley felt that perhaps he was reconciled,
and had returned to his old pursuit of
secluded ballroom corners. But Nolan assured
her of the injustice of this. Lem had
forsaken all his former haunts, and had become
a recluse, brooding alone in his deserted
home.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It will do him good, even if it does not
last,&#8221; Nolan said. &#8220;Almost any one would
grieve for a woman like Miriam for a few
months.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is permanent this time, and
there will be a reconciliation, and both live
happily ever after,&#8221; said Eveley, with her
usual buoyant faith in the cheerful outcome.
</p>
<p>Gordon Cameron she had seen only once
since Miriam&#8217;s departure, and that was when
he came at her request to receive Miriam&#8217;s
message. He had listened quietly, while she
repeated the words of her friend.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I expected it, of course,&#8221; he said at last
gravely. &#8220;The pity of it is that her little revolution
was so hopeless from the beginning.
As long as a woman loves her husband, she
can not hope for happiness, nor even for forgetfulness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she does not love her husband any
more,&#8221; said Eveley confidently. &#8220;Not a bit.
She is over that long ago.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That was the whole trouble,&#8221; he insisted.
&#8220;If she had not loved him, she could have
stood it and gone her way. But loving him,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
the situation was impossible for a woman of
spirit and pride. Well, there is always one
to pay in every triangle, and this time the
bill comes to me. But I had anticipated that
from the beginning. She is a wonderful woman.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think she will go back to her husband?&#8221;
asked Eveley breathlessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hardly think so. She might as well,
though; perhaps it would be better. She can
not be happy without him, and she was certainly
not happy with him. It is only a
choice of miseries. As long as she loves him,
she will suffer for it. I begin to think that
one who loves can not be happy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, one can. One is,&#8221; asserted Eveley
positively.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps I should say, when one is married
to it,&#8221; he added, with a sober smile for her
assurance.
</p>
<p>Then he had gone away, and when Lem&#8217;s
pleadings had suddenly ceased, Eveley felt
that the little tempest would live its life, and
die its death, and perhaps Miriam at least
would find happiness in the lull that followed.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_286' name='page_286'></a>286</span></p>
<p>So it was something of a shock to have her
pleasant Sunday morning nap disturbed by
Lem pounding briskly upon her window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Get up, immediately,&#8221; he said in an assertive
voice quite different from his futile
and inane pleadings of a short while before.
&#8220;Hurry, Eveley, I want you. Dress for motoring,
my car is here. I shall wait in the
garden&mdash;give you ten minutes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;He must want me for a bridesmaid for his
second wedding,&#8221; thought Eveley resentfully,
as she hurriedly dressed. But accustomed to
obey the calls of friendship, she put on a
heavy sport skirt and sweater, and had even
pulled her soft hat over her curls before she
went to the window.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am ready, but I do not approve of it,&#8221;
she began rather unpleasantly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better take a doughnut, or a roll,
or an orange, or something, for we have no
time for breakfast,&#8221; he said in the same assertive
voice. &#8220;She will not be back until
afternoon, Miss Ledesma. Sorry if it interferes
with any of your plans, but it can not
be helped. Get your coat, quickly, Eveley.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It does interfere with our plans,&#8221; she said
crossly. &#8220;We were going up to the mountains
for a beefsteak fry with Jimmy and Nolan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Never mind,&#8221; said Marie softly. &#8220;It may
come another Sunday. Mr. Landis seems to
need you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All ready, Eveley? Let me help you.
Good-by, Miss Ledesma.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Eveley found herself marching briskly
down the rustic steps away from her own
plan and her own desire, and with no knowledge
of what lay before her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You might at least tell me where we are
going,&#8221; she said at last, after he had hurried
her into the car and started away.
</p>
<p>&#8220;To see Miriam,&#8221; he answered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh!&#8221; Eveley&#8217;s voice was a long gasp. She
was content to wait after that for his explanation,
although it was very slow in coming.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She is at a ranch up in the mountains,&#8221;
he said finally. &#8220;About fifty miles. We just
located her last night. I have been looking,
for her all the time. You are going to talk
to her for me.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, am I?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I was afraid to come alone for fear
she would not see me. She will not refuse to
see you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you mind telling me what I am going
to say to her?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He was silent a while, thinking. &#8220;She refused
to take any money from me,&#8221; he said,
presently. &#8220;And she has very little. If she
persists in this, she will have to work for her
living. Miriam can not do that.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Eveley softly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She does not want me for a husband yet,&#8221;
he said humbly. &#8220;And that is right. But I
must have Miriam, and she shall never have
any one else but me&mdash;not that I think she
would ever want anybody else. You are to
tell Miriam she must come home, and live her
life just as she wishes and do as she pleases
in everything, and allow me to be a servant
for her, to provide what she wants and needs,
to take care of her if she is sick. Tell her
she may have any friends she likes, lovers
even if she wishes, but that she must let me
work for her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></p>
<p>Eveley laid her hand affectionately upon
his arm. &#8220;I have never done you justice,
Lem; forgive me. I think Miriam will come
home. I hope she will.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She has to. And after a while, when she
sees in me what she used to think was there,
she will love me again. But in the meantime,
I shall ask nothing and expect nothing. But
Miriam has got to be in the house.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley only spoke once after that.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If she will not come?&#8221;
</p>
<p>He turned upon her then, a sudden grim
smile lighting his face. &#8220;I know what I shall
do then,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But you will think it is
madness. If she refuses to come, I shall
make the necessary arrangements, and kidnap
her. She&#8217;s got to come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley burst into quick laughter at the picture
that came to her&mdash;a picture of the old-time,
immaculate Lem of the ballrooms, carrying
his wife away into the mountains to
live a cave-man life.
</p>
<p>He laughed with her, but the dead-set of
his face remained. &#8220;It sounds like a joke,&#8221;
he admitted. &#8220;But I have made up my mind.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span>
Miriam is mine, and I am going to have her.
We&#8217;ll just go up into the mountains for a few
months, and she will see that I am cured.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Mile after mile they drove in silence up the
steep mountain grades, and after a long time
he drew the car off beside the road under a
cluster of trees.
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is the ranch, but I will not drive in.
If she saw us coming she would not talk to us,
so you must catch her unawares. I shall wait
here for you. You&#8217;d better not tell her I am
going to kidnap her, I think I would rather
take her by surprise. She has to come,
Eve, now make her see it. Just a servant
that is all I want to be to her for a while. But
she did love me, and she will again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Eveley walked swiftly up the drive to
the house, keeping in the shadow as much as
possible, surprised to know that after all the
years of her disgust for the husband of her
friend, her sympathies now were all with
him.
</p>
<p>At the kitchen door she assumed her most
winsome and disarming smile and asked for
Mrs. Landis.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span></p>
<p>&#8220;She does not wish to see any one,&#8221; said
the woman quickly. &#8220;She said particularly
that she would not see any callers.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But she will see me, I am sure,&#8221; said
Eveley coaxingly. &#8220;You ask her. Tell her
it is Eveley Ainsworth. She always sees me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But she told me particularly,&#8221; repeated
the woman. &#8220;And she is not here anyhow.
She has gone over the hill. She likes to be
among the pines. She is not well, either. I
am sorry, miss, but she is not here, and she
would not see you if she were.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;How far is it to the hill? And does she
stay long?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is not far,&#8221; said the woman, with a
wave of her hand toward the east. &#8220;But she
will not come home for luncheon. She has
no appetite. And the boys are out, so I have
no one to send for her. I am sorry, miss.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You think there is no use to wait, then?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no use at all, miss. She will be gone
for hours, and she would not see you if she
were here.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell her I came, won&#8217;t you? Eveley Ainsworth.
Thank you.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span></p>
<p>And with another disarming smile Eveley
turned back to the path. But as soon as she
was out of sight of the house, she slipped off
through the trees, and started on a light run
for the pine grove on the hill to the east.
</p>
<p>&#8220;As Lem says, poor thing, she has to,&#8221; she
said to herself, with a smile. And very soon
she was among the big pines, looking eagerly
back and forth, quite determined not to return
to Lem until she had seen Miriam and
talked her into reason. And so at last she
came upon her, sitting somberly under the
big trees, her back against a huge boulder,
staring away down the mountains into the
haze of the sea in the west, where her husband
lived in the city by the bay.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Miriam,&#8221; Eveley called in a ringing voice,
and ran joyously down the path.
</p>
<p>Miriam sprang up to meet her. &#8220;Eveley!&#8221;
she cried, catching her hands eagerly. And
then, &#8220;Have you seen&mdash;Lem? Is he&mdash;all
right?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley held her hands a moment, looking
searchingly into the thin face and the
shadowy eyes.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Revolutions are hard work, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;
she asked with deep sympathy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Eveley, they are killing, heart-breaking,
soul-wracking,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;And yet of
course it was right and best for me to come,&#8221;
she added gravely. &#8220;Does Lem seem to&mdash;miss
me?&#8221; And there was wistfulness in her
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He is out there now,&#8221; said Eveley, waving
her hand toward the road. &#8220;He brought me
up.&#8221;
</p>
<p>At the first word, Miriam had turned quickly,
ready to run down&mdash;not to the house for
shelter, but to the car for comfort. But she
stopped in a moment, and came back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall not see him, of course,&#8221; she said
quietly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I brought a message from him. He says
you must come home, Miriam, he says his
madness is all purged away, and that you are
his and he must have you. But he wants you
to come and live your own life and do as you
wish, only allowing him, to stay in the home
not as your husband, but as your servant
until you learn to love and trust him again.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_294' name='page_294'></a>294</span>
He says you must come, and let him work for
you, and take care of you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Miriam&#8217;s face was very white, and her eyes
deep wells of pain.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Lem!&#8221; she said tenderly. &#8220;So sweet&mdash;and
so weak.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he is finding strength,&#8221; said
Eveley.
</p>
<p>For a long time, the two girls stood there,
side by side, Eveley looking into the haze of
the sea miles below, Miriam staring down
through the pines to where she knew a car
might be waiting in the shadows.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must not keep him waiting,&#8221; she said
at last.
</p>
<p>Without a word, they turned, hand in hand
and started down to the road again. When
she saw the little, well-known car beneath the
trees, and Lem standing rigid beside it, she
caught her breath suddenly. Eveley would
have hung back, to let her greet her husband
alone, but Miriam clung to her hand and
pulled her forward.
</p>
<p>He came to meet them, awkwardly, a gleam
of hope in his eyes, but meekness in his manner.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span>
He held out his hand, and Miriam with
a little flutter dropped her own into it, pulling
it quickly away again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you&mdash;all right, Lem? You look&mdash;thin,&#8221;
she said with shy solicitude.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel thin,&#8221; he replied grimly. &#8220;Are&mdash;you
coming with us?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; said Eveley.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course,&#8221; Miriam echoed faintly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Shall I drive?&#8221; suggested Eveley, anticipating
complete reconciliation for the two in
their first moment of privacy.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I will drive,&#8221; said Lem. &#8220;You girls sit in
the back. Did Eveley explain that I only expect
to be&mdash;your driver, and your valet, and
your servant&mdash;for a while.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Tears brightened in Miriam&#8217;s eyes. &#8220;Oh,
Lem,&#8221; she cried, holding out her hands.
&#8220;How can people talk of servants who have
loved&mdash;as we have loved?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley immediately went into a deep and
concentrated study of the rear tires, for
Miriam was close in her husband&#8217;s arms, and
his tears were falling upon her fragrant
curls.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></p>
<p>After a while, he held her away from him
and looked into her tender face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It isn&#8217;t&mdash;you aren&#8217;t coming, then, just because
it is your duty to give me every
chance,&#8221; he whispered.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, no, dear, just because I love you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley was still utterly immersed in the
condition of the tires.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll try it again, Lem&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Miriam,&#8221; he broke in, &#8220;it isn&#8217;t any
trial this time. This is marriage.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eventually they got started toward home
and had driven many miles before Miriam noticed
that her uncovered hair was blowing in
the wind, and remembered that she had left
the ranch without notice and that all her
things were there. But what were simple
things and formal notices when human
hearts were finding happiness and faith?
</p>
<p>In the Cloud Cote, Eve&#8217;s friends were patiently
awaiting her return. Nolan was reading
poetry aloud to himself in the roof
garden, and Lieutenant Ames was laboriously
picking chords on the piano, with
Marie near him strumming on the mandolin.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></p>
<p>The first creak of the rustic stair brought
them all to the landing to greet her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Reconciliation,&#8221; shouted Nolan, before she
was half-way up. &#8220;Miriam is home, and they
have already lived happily ever after.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley began immediately to give an account
of the day&#8217;s happenings standing motionless
on the third step from the top until
she finished her recital.
</p>
<p>Then she went back down, and gave an impatient
tap on the seventh stair.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, you started something,&#8221; she said to
it solemnly. &#8220;And you ought to be satisfied
now, if anybody is. To-morrow I shall crown
you with a wreath of laurel.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then she went up again. &#8220;Does this do
anything to your theory about duty?&#8221; asked
Nolan. &#8220;Does it prove it, or disprove it, or
what? I can not seem to get any connection.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But there is a connection,&#8221; she said, with a
smile. &#8220;It absolutely and everlastingly proves
the Exception.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eveley Ainsworth, don&#8217;t ever say exception
again until you can explain it,&#8221; cried
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span>
Nolan. &#8220;I dream of exceptions by night, and
I legalize them by day. Be a nice girl, and do
a good deed this Sabbath Day by expounding
the virtues of the One Exception.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Eveley was hungry, and said she could
not expound anything when her system
clamored for tea.
</p>
<p>Eveley&#8217;s Sabbath, however, was not yet
ended. While she was blissfully sipping her
tea, the three she loved best in the world
about her, there came a gentle tap upon her
window, and Mrs. Severs walked in.
</p>
<p>&#8220;So sorry to bother you, Miss Ainsworth,&#8221;
she began apologetically, &#8220;but I want to ask
a favor. Father is moving back with us to-day,
and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What!&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed he is,&#8221; she cried blithely. &#8220;I
was so lonesome, and some days I am so ill,
that I asked him as a personal favor if he
wouldn&#8217;t come and try me just once more, and
he said, Holy Mackinaw! he had been aching
to do that very thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Eveley said judiciously, &#8220;I suppose
you will all be satisfied now that you are back
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
in your old rut wretchedly doing your duty
by each other.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I should say not,&#8221; denied Mrs. Severs
promptly. &#8220;I asked father to come because
I&mdash;like him awfully much, and it is so lonely
without him, and he is coming because he
missed us and is fond of us, and there isn&#8217;t
any duty about it. You have converted us.
We do not believe in duty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And the favor?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;father is bringing the flivver of
course&mdash;and the garage is so big. Do you
mind if we keep it there with your car? We
will pay any extra rent, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep it there by all means,&#8221; said Eveley
generously. &#8220;And there is no rent. And
when I get stuck anywhere I shall expect you
to tow me home for love.&#8221; And when Mrs.
Severs had gone, Eveley said: &#8220;Make another
pot of tea, please, Marie. Make two
pots&mdash;three if you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Pretty hard to keep some people properly
adjusted, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; asked Nolan soberly, but
with laughter in his eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is proved by the case of Father-in-law
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
and the Bride, Eveley?&#8221; asked Marie
with a soft teasing smile as she refilled
Eveley&#8217;s cup.
</p>
<p>But Eveley went into a remote corner of
the room, and brandished the bread knife for
protection, before she cried triumphantly:
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Exception. It is another positive
proof of the utter efficacy of my One Exception.&#8221;

<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>SHE DOUBTS HER THEORY</h3>
</div>

<p>One morning Eveley telephoned from the
office to Marie that she would not be
home for dinner that night, as she was going
with Kitty to hear the minute details of her
engagement, and the plans of her coming
marriage with Arnold. She assured Marie
that she would be home early, begged her not
to be lonesome, cautioned her once more not
to venture into the canyon after nightfall,
and went serenely on her way.
</p>
<p>At ten o&#8217;clock that night she guided her
car into the garage whistling boyishly, and
ran up the rustic stairs, stopping with painful
suddenness on the landing as she observed
there was no light in the Cote.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie,&#8221; she called, &#8220;Marie!&#8221;
</p>
<p>She looked anxiously over the little roof
garden, and peered down to the canyon.
Twice she went up to the window, and each
time drew back again, afraid to enter.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span></p>
<p>She leaned over the railing on the roof, calling
aimlessly and hopelessly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie, Marie!&#8221;
</p>
<p>A moment later she heard a light step below,
&#8220;Oh, Marie,&#8221; she cried and her voice was
a sob.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s me, Miss Eveley, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
</p>
<p>It was only Angelo running up the steps
to her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Angelo, what are you doing here?&#8221; she
demanded sharply, her nerves on edge.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I was just fooling around,&#8221; he said
evasively. &#8220;I thought I heard you calling.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But Eveley&#8217;s nerves were too highly strung
this night to brook an idle answer. She
caught him by the shoulder.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell me where you have been and what
you were doing,&#8221; and there was something
like suspicion in her voice.
</p>
<p>And then suddenly the little bit of foreign
flotsam became a man, to give her courage.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Come inside and sit down,&#8221; he said authoritatively.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you what I&#8217;ve been
doing, but don&#8217;t stand out here like this and
get yourself all worked up for nothing.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></p>
<p>He threw up the window, and went in first,
turning on the light, and Eveley followed him
numbly.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now sit down and I&#8217;ll tell you. I have
been sleeping in the garage ever since you
got mixed up with that bunch of Bolshevists
and&mdash;er Greasers. I thought something
might happen and I&#8217;ve sort of stuck around.
I had a key made to the garage, and I&#8217;ve got
a nice bed fixed up in the attic.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley held out her hand with a faint
smile. &#8220;You are a good friend, Angelo, sure
enough. But there was no danger. And oh,
where can my Marie have gone?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are her things here?&#8221;
</p>
<p>Acting instantly upon the suggestion,
Eveley ran into the other room followed closely
by Angelo. Every slightest scrap and
shred that had been Marie&#8217;s had disappeared.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe she left a note somewhere,&#8221; said
Angelo.
</p>
<p>Frantically Eveley flashed through the
small rooms, searching eagerly for some final
word or token. But there was nothing to be
found.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_304' name='page_304'></a>304</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Some one has kidnapped her,&#8221; she cried,
wringing her hands. &#8220;We must phone the
police.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t do that&mdash;not yet. I&#8217;d phone
for Mr. Nolan first. Let me do it. And why
don&#8217;t you go down-stairs and ask them if
they saw any one around here to-day, or saw
her leaving?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, Angelo, that is fine,&#8221; she cried. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
go&mdash;and you phone Nolan quickly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>By the time she returned, Nolan was on
his way to the Cote.
</p>
<p>&#8220;She&mdash;she left herself&mdash;just walked away
with her bag&mdash;alone,&#8221; said Eveley faintly. &#8220;I
am afraid she did not&mdash;care for me.&#8221; And
there was sorrow in her voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure she did,&#8221; said Angela reassuringly.
&#8220;That&#8217;s why she left I guess. She may
be in bad in some way, and so she went off
not to get you mixed up in it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you think that, Angelo? Do you
really? But she should not have gone for
that. I would have stood by Marie through
any kind of trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Angelo walked impatiently about the room,
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
fingering endless little objects, puzzling in his
mind what to say and what to do.
</p>
<p>&#8220;He could be here if he had taken a taxi,&#8221;
he said restlessly. &#8220;I told him to beat it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We might phone Mr. Hiltze,&#8221; said Eveley
suddenly. &#8220;He may know where to find her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Angelo smiled scornfully at that. &#8220;Aw
gee, Miss Eveley, ain&#8217;t you on to them yet?
Sure they are working in cahoots.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley sat down at once and folded her
hands. &#8220;Now, Angelo, tell me everything
you know, or suspect about them. Begin at
the beginning. You may be wrong, but let
me hear it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But before Angelo could begin his little
story, Nolan came springing up the steps, and
knew in a word all they had to tell.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit down now, Nolan, and listen. Angelo
thinks he knows something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, when Carranza got in, a lot of Mexicans
had to get out. Political refugees they
call them. Marie is one of them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That is no secret,&#8221; said Eveley. &#8220;She told
me that herself. And it is nothing to her discredit&mdash;rather
the opposite I should think.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, but they are looking ahead to the
next election. That guy Obregon has promised
to let all the refugees come back free
and easy if he is elected, and no questions
asked. But they&#8217;ve got such a lot running
for president, that maybe they won&#8217;t elect
anybody and then Carranza will stick on himself.
And so the refugees on this side are
working up a new little revolution of their
own, to spring on Carranza the day after the
election. And that is against the law, and
the Secret Service is on to it, and after them
hot and heavy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Secret Service,&#8221; said Eveley slowly.
&#8220;The Secret Service.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She crossed the room, and from her bag
took out a small bit of steel which she had
carried there for weeks.
</p>
<p>&#8220;The Secret Service,&#8221; she said again, and
held the badge tightly in her hand.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What have you there, Eveley?&#8221; asked
Nolan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing,&#8221; she said, gripping it so tightly
the sharp edges cut into her hand. &#8220;Just a
little souvenir&mdash;of Marie. That is all.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Well, is there anything else, Angelo?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;That guy Hiltze is a crook, too. He&#8217;s
what you call a Red. He&#8217;s mixed up with
all the funny business going on.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you sure, Angelo? You must only
tell us what you really know.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, they&#8217;ve got a lot of crazy shacks
around town, and they hold meetings. My
dad goes to &#8217;em. So a few times I went, too.
This guy Hiltze does the talking. He&#8217;s got
enough money. He don&#8217;t have to sell autos
for a living, he does that for a blind, just
like he strings Miss Eveley on the Americanization
hot-air stuff.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you ever hear him speak?&#8221; asked
Nolan.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. He says they are chasing him from
cellar to garret, from mountain to desert.
He says they are the damned rich, and they
got to keep him harried to earth so they can
grind the laborers under their heel. He gives
&#8217;em all money for doing things, and hauling
stuff, and getting things across the border.
I was there. He says they must pray God to
strengthen them to fight to the last ditch. He
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span>
says the army and navy are the slaves of the
God of Money.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I know he had rather&mdash;advanced ideas,&#8221;
said Eveley gravely. &#8220;But these are such
troublous times. Every one feels the lack,
and the need in the social life. He may have
gone too far&mdash;but these are the days that try
one&#8217;s soul. If it was only talk&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Aw gee,&#8221; interrupted Angelo. &#8220;They
ain&#8217;t got no room to talk. I know all about
that stuff. I was over there with the rest
of &#8217;em, and I know. We slept on straw, and
dressed in rags, and lived like dogs. And
they come to a decent country, and get soured
because they ain&#8217;t fed up on chicken and wine
like a lord. It&#8217;s a darn&#8217; sight more than they
ever had before, and the Secret Service needs
to watch &#8217;em. For they&#8217;re the ones that did
for Russia&mdash;yes, and they&#8217;re doing it for
Germany now, and trying it on Italy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>The Secret Service&mdash;the diagnostician of
social unrest, with professional finger on the
pulse of the foreign element&mdash;had that finger
touched the wrist of Marie?
</p>
<p>&#8220;But this isn&#8217;t finding my Marie,&#8221; said
Eveley. &#8220;I want her.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s call Lieutenant Ames,&#8221; said Nolan
suddenly. &#8220;I rather imagine this will hit
him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, poor Jimmy,&#8221; cried Eveley. &#8220;He told
me he wanted to marry her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Far into the night, they puzzled and pondered,
not knowing which way to turn, but
all in their love of Marie resolved that she
must be found and saved again from the
chaos. The next day, against the advice of
all the others, Eveley sent word to Amos
Hiltze and seemed to feel some comfort in his
evident surprise and perturbation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I can not understand it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;She
was so happy, and loved you so much. I will
look for her. She may have taken fright at
something&mdash;but what could it possibly have
been?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Tell her I do not care what has happened,
nor what she fears. She must come to me
and I will help her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In spite of the insistence of Nolan, Angelo
and Jimmy Ames, Eveley would have given
the matter into the hands of the police, trusting
to her own promises and her own standing
to save Marie from whatever they held
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
against her. But at her first suggestion of
this to Amos Hiltze, he took a most positive
stand against it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;If you do that, you have lost her forever.
It is the police she fears. She would never
forgive you for putting her into their hands,
even if you could afterward extricate her.
You must not dream of such a thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Eveley gave it up and tried to reconcile
herself to patient waiting, and to prayers of
faith, determined to believe that the persistent
search going on in all sections of the
town would be effective, and believing still
more fervently that God must return to her
again the sister she had learned to love.
</p>
<p>This time, because Eveley was suffering
no one connected the disappearance of Marie
with Eveley&#8217;s theory of duty. And to herself
Eveley made no claims, not even for her
favorite Exception.
</p>
<p>For if Marie had loved her, would she not
have left at least one word of sympathy, and
affection, in farewell? Indeed, if she had
loved her, would she not have preferred the
investigation of the Secret Service to separation?
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
For Eveley would have braved every
court in the country for her little foreign sister.
</p>
<p>She tried to interest herself in the affairs
of her friends, as of old. She tried to return
to her old whimsical routine of living alone
in her Cloud Cote, but from being a little nook
of laughter and love, it became ineffably
dreary and dull. And Eveley was suffering
not only because her love had been slighted
and her hospitality abused, but because
everything she had undertaken had failed.
Americanization&mdash;what was it? For to Marie
she had given every good thing in her power&mdash;and
Marie had used her as long as she
could be of service, and then had gone back
to her own life, to her own people.

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>SHE PROVES HER PRINCIPLE</h3>
</div>

<p>All of Eveley&#8217;s friends, realizing the
loneliness and the sickness of heart
which possessed her, united to plan little
entertainments and bits of amusement for
her. And Eveley accepted their plans gratefully,
and acted upon their suggestions
gladly, but the bitterness remained in her
heart.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I loved that girl,&#8221; she would say to herself.
&#8220;How could she do such a thing to any
one who loved her? It isn&#8217;t as if I had only
tried to do what was right and kind by her.
She owed me something for all that love.&#8221;
</p>
<p>One evening she went to Eileen&#8217;s for a rollicking
dinner with the twins in clamorous
evidence. Eileen&#8217;s home was a new creation;
every day, she said frankly, was a new cycle
of life. Her years of sober, studied business
had not at all prepared her for the raptures
and the uncertainties and the annoyances and
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span>
the thrills of a household that had young
twins in it.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Billy bosses Betty unmercifully, and I do
not believe in the dominance of men,&#8221; she
told Eveley. &#8220;And Betty charms Billy into
submission, and I do not approve of the blandishments
of woman upon man. And yet my
sympathies are with both of them, and I
adore them both. And I can never find anything
when I want it, and when I do find it
there is something wrong with it, and they
both talk at once and I have to talk at the
same time or I never get anything said, and
yet we have wonderful times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are certainly doing your duty by
those babies,&#8221; said Eveley tentatively.
</p>
<p>Eileen took it quickly. &#8220;Um, not a bit of
it. I am just fulfilling the desire of my heart.
So you may take it that I am proving your
theory if you like.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;At least you are proving my exception,&#8221;
said Eveley, with a smile.
</p>
<p>&#8220;What is the exception?&#8221; Eileen questioned
eagerly. &#8220;It seems to get all the proving,
doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_314' name='page_314'></a>314</span></p>
<p>&#8220;It used to,&#8221; said Eveley gravely. &#8220;But
I have lost faith in it for myself. It worked
for everybody else, but it failed for me. Now
let&#8217;s talk of something else.&#8221;
</p>
<p>They were in the midst of a merry game
with the children, when the bell rang, and
Eveley was called to the door, to look into the
face of Amos Hiltze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You have found Marie,&#8221; she cried out at
once.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. She is at the ranch in the mountains
where we found her first. She is in trouble,
and sick. I told her I would come for you,
but I suppose you can not leave yet?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not leave&mdash;when Marie is sick and wants
me? Wait until I get my wraps. Shall we
go in my car?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, please. I was up at the Cote for you,
and Mrs. Severs said you were here. I let the
taxi go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley&#8217;s face was alight with joy, and her
heart sang with happiness. Marie had been
sick&mdash;it had not been cold neglect that kept
her away and silent. And she had sent for
Eveley.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></p>
<p>&#8220;You are certainly a wonder,&#8221; said Amos
Hiltze, as she slipped into her place behind
the wheel, and he took his seat at her side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not know how happy I am,&#8221; she
cried, turning the car toward the country.
&#8220;You&mdash;do get so awfully fond of a girl like
Marie, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Is she very sick?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not very. She will be better when she
sees you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did she really leave me?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, she was afraid the Secret Service
would locate her, and it would get you into
trouble.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I might have known it was her duty. Wait
till I get my hands on that girl. I&#8217;ll tell her
a few things about duty that will astonish
her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Already they were wheeling rapidly
through East San Diego, and when a motorcycle
pulled up beside them, Eveley stopped
with a gasp. Of course she had been speeding&mdash;a
thousand miles an hour, probably,
though it had seemed like crawling.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am so sorry, Officer,&#8221; she began quickly.
&#8220;But I have to hurry. I have a little friend
in the country who is sick and needs me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, is it you, Miss Ainsworth?&#8221; And
the officer smiled. &#8220;I did not recognize you.
That is all right. Your car is a Rolls, isn&#8217;t it?
We are looking for a man in a Rolls&mdash;but I
can hardly hold you.&#8221; He turned his pocket
flash upon Amos Hiltze.
</p>
<p>&#8220;This is my friend, Mr. Hiltze,&#8221; she explained.
&#8220;I think you do not want him,
either.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I think not. Yet our man is supposed
to have come this way. If you see any men
on foot, or any one in trouble, better not stop.
We&#8217;ll have a man out that way pretty soon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you,&#8221; said Eveley. &#8220;Good night.&#8221;
And again they were on their way.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Poor Mr. Man in the Rolls,&#8221; she said after
a while. &#8220;I wonder what mischief he has
been into.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I hope he gets away. Perhaps he is not so
bad as they think, and may do better next
time. Or maybe he had a reason.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I am sure of that,&#8221; said Hiltze with some
earnestness. &#8220;There is always a reason, I
think.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Through La Mesa, through El Cajon, they
drove in silence as they had driven once before,
when they went for Marie the first time.
Only then Eveley had been quivering with
anxiety and nervousness&mdash;and now it was
only hope and joy. But was it only hope and
joy? For she realized suddenly that her
hands were gripping the wheel with nervous
intensity, and that she was shivering.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you cold?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not know,&#8221; she faltered.
</p>
<p>He turned slightly in his seat, and reached
for a rug.
</p>
<p>&#8220;A disorderly pile on the floor as usual,&#8221;
he said with a slight smile. &#8220;Don&#8217;t your
friends ever put the rugs back on the rack,
Eveley?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, never,&#8221; she replied, smiling, too, but
gravely.
</p>
<p>He tucked the rug closely about her, but
she still shivered, and a sense of dread was
heavy upon her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span></p>
<p>When they came at last to the branch in
the road, he looked carefully about in every
direction, and then told her to drive quickly.
Under his direction she took the car far back
from the road in a sheltered place, and
stopped the engine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please hurry, will you? I have not Angelo
with me this time, and I am afraid.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eveley, I must talk to you first. You
know I love you, you must know it. You have
tried to discourage me, but I will not take
discouragement. I shall never go away without
you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Are you going away?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, to-night. Business takes me away.
I am going to South America. I have money&mdash;lots
of money, and we can start afresh and
do well. But I can not go without you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Mr. Hiltze, it is impossible. I do not love
you. I told you that before.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But you will love me. If you come away
with me, and take time, you can love me. I
will be good to you, and not hurry you. You
must let yourself go, and try.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span></p>
<p>&#8220;But I do not wish to. Love should not
be forced. It ought to come spontaneously of
itself. And I love Nolan.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Damn Nolan! Oh, I don&#8217;t mean that, but&mdash;Eveley,
you will forget him. Just come
with me, and give yourself time. Marie will
go with us&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, she has promised to go with us, to
help make you happy.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then she is not sick?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;No, not sick.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You only brought me here to&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Eveley. I am sorry, but I had to.
We are going out by aeroplane to-night, and
there is a fishing fleet at sea waiting to pick
us up. I hated to trick you, but it was my
love that forced it. I can not give you up.
I will not. Did you think I was a fool to be
with you, and know your loving lovely ways,
and&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Suddenly he crushed her in his arms, and
for a moment she was helpless. Then he released
her.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_320' name='page_320'></a>320</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your bag is here&mdash;yes, in the back of the
car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;My bag?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I took Marie to the Cote this afternoon
and she packed it for you&mdash;things necessary
until you can shop again.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie did that?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I told her to. I told her you wished
it. Oh, yes, I lied, but I would do worse than
that for you, yes, I would kill for you. Now
be reasonable, Eveley, and come with us
nicely. You shall have all the time you wish.
I know you will love me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Love you. Love you after this! I hate
you, I despise you. Do not say you love me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eveley, be quiet, this will do no possible
good.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then it was you they were looking for,
in the car? You are a common criminal.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Not a criminal, no,&#8221; he cried furiously.
&#8220;Yes, they wanted me, of course. You should
have known there was a reason why a man
like myself should live as I have done here.
But we are not criminals&mdash;we are advance
agents of freedom.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_321' name='page_321'></a>321</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Anarchists,&#8221; she interrupted, in a cutting
voice.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Some time there must be justice and
equality in the world&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you have got rich by preaching lawlessness.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eveley, do not talk like that. I&mdash;I lose
my head&mdash;and I do not wish to frighten you.
Sit quietly, and let me tell you. Peace can
come only through warfare&mdash;and out of the
death throes of an old world, a new world of
peace will&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You are traitors.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Eveley, you know I was in the service, but
there must be a union of the free men of the
world against oppression&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Do not make stump speeches to me. I will
not stand for it. Justice and freedom will
come to the world, but not through lying and
trickery and bloodshed. Justice must come
through sympathy and love and comradeship.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It did not get you far with Marie, though,
did it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_322' name='page_322'></a>322</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Certainly. That was my interest in her.
Marie was working with us, doing what she
could for us, for what we could do for her
in Mexico. She is a regular traitor if you
like, putting things over in great style, on you
and Nolan and Ames&mdash;the whole bunch of
you. She is a slick little devil. But I fell&mdash;because
I loved you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Sudden illumination came to Eveley.
&#8220;Then that is why she left me. When she
learned to love me, she would not profane our
friendship. That is why she left.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;She left because the cops were getting
wise, and she had to get out in a hurry or get
pinched.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And she is going with you&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. She will be the idol of the revolutionists
for what she has done&mdash;they will
carry her about on a tin platter.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will let me go now, Mr. Hiltze, please.
But tell Marie that I understand everything,
and when she wishes to come back to me,
the Cote is open. It was only a mistaken
loyalty to a wrong principle. Please go, I
want to hurry home.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_323' name='page_323'></a>323</span></p>
<p>He laughed a little. &#8220;Eveley, you are going
to South America with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>In a sudden panic she turned, flinging open
the door of the car, hoping to rush away into
the darkness, but his arm held her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;You will love me. I may not care for
your Americanization, but I love you. I am
going to be good to you. Don&#8217;t be a fool,
Eveley, it will do you no good. You&#8217;ve got
to go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Struggling was in vain, as Eveley realized
at once, and she subsided quickly, trying to
think. The thing was impossible. It could
not be. Such things did not happen any
more&mdash;not in real life in the United States.
It was cruel, preposterous, unbelievable.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Please let me go,&#8221; she pleaded. &#8220;I shall
not try to report you, you can get away without
trouble. But let me go home, please. I
could never change toward you&mdash;I am not
the kind that changes.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall have to tie you for a few minutes.
I am sorry, but I do not wish you to go to
the shack. I have wasted a lot of time trying
to reason with you. Put out your hands&mdash;yes
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_324' name='page_324'></a>324</span>
yes, that way, and let me tie them to the
wheel. I hate to do this&mdash;there is no use for
you to yell, Eveley, for no one can hear, so
I shall not gag you. Let me wrap the blanket
about you; it is very cold. Sit still, dear,
and do not shake it off. I love you very
much. We are going to start the world
afresh with a clean slate, and leave the past
behind. The future shall be of your choosing,
only it must be with me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then he went away, and Eveley began a
valiant tugging on the straps that bound her.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, Eveley, I&#8217;ll cut them,&#8221;
came a friendly whisper, and Eveley with a
cry turned to look into Angelo&#8217;s face.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure, I come along,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I saw him
up at the house, and when he came down for
you, I followed his taxi on my bike. And
when he went in to get you, I got into the
back under the rugs. Lucky he only took one
rug for you, or he&#8217;d got hold of my legs. Gee,
he uses good straps.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All this, while Angelo was sawing on the
straps with his rusty knife, and almost before
he finished talking, Eveley was free.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_325' name='page_325'></a>325</span></p>
<p>Like a flash she was starting the engine.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose you get out and hide a while, and
let me scout around,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I hate to
leave a decent sort like your Marie with those
cutthroats. Maybe I can get hold of her.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, do try. I&#8217;ll hide among the bushes
for fear they come while you are gone. Be
careful, Angelo. We are going to need you.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley waited what seemed an endless
length of time, crouching almost breathless
under the shrubs. But finally she heard light
running steps, and in a moment Marie was
in her arms.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, my poor child, they told me you
wanted to go. And did they tie you&mdash;the
cruel straps? You are free now, and you
will go back to your Cote and be happy. But
do not forget your poor Marie. And never
play with fire again, sweet; in the end it always
burns. American women never know
what a tempest love can be. Now, kiss Marie,
and say your forgive her, and then go
quickly.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Marie, come with me,&#8221; begged Eveley,
clinging to her. &#8220;You must not go with them.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_326' name='page_326'></a>326</span>
They are treacherous, selling their honor for
money. Do not trust them. Come with me.
Nolan and I will take care of you, and Nolan
will straighten out your tangles with the
law. And Jimmy is wild for you, raging all
over town trying to find you. Please, dear,
let all the ugly past lie dead, and live a new
life with us here. Oh, I can not let you go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;For them I care nothing,&#8221; Marie cried,
with a smart snap of her fingers. &#8220;They are
dogs. They only help us for money, and they
wish only to embroil the world in war. It is
no love for us&mdash;but they are cheap&mdash;we buy
them. When the time comes, we tramp them
under our feet. Eveley, if you wish me, I
will come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then in a moment they were away, the car
swinging dizzily down the steep grade rocking
from side to side.
</p>
<p>&#8220;How did you get Marie, Angelo&mdash;you
angel?&#8221; asked Eveley, after a while.
</p>
<p>&#8220;They were all running around moving
things, and Marie was helping. So I pitched
in and helped too. When I walked by Marie
she understood and came. And they did not
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_327' name='page_327'></a>327</span>
notice. There isn&#8217;t much difference between
a Wop and a Greaser.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And you will never leave me again,
Marie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am all through with hatred and strife,
now. I want only a home, where I can be
happy, and live as you and I have lived. That
is the only Americanization. Talk is nothing.
Social service is a game. But when one
makes living so fine that every one in the
world wants to live that way&mdash;then it is
Americanization. I am satisfied now.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Say, you&#8217;d better cut the talk and watch
the road,&#8221; said Angelo suddenly. &#8220;You&#8217;ve
been half over the grade a dozen times.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I will,&#8221; promised Eveley. &#8220;But I
must hurry. They will follow us&mdash;will they
follow us, Marie?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, surely, when they miss us. They
have motorcycles. Listen. Hear them far
back? Of course they would follow.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Sit tight, Marie, and do not worry. I
know this road all right.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They are gaining on us, dear. Can you
do better?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_328' name='page_328'></a>328</span></p>
<p>But Eveley was afraid to go faster on
those sharp curves, though she strained her
eyes to see the road before them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We are nearly to Flynn Springs,&#8221; she
said. &#8220;We must be. We can stop there.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;They will soon be up with us,&#8221; said
Angelo, looking back.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We must leave the car, and hide in the
woods,&#8221; said Marie.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I am afraid to leave the car.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;The woods will not hurt us. It is only
men who harm. Come, we must. If they
catch us, we are lost. Pull out here to the
left, and turn off the lights. They may pass
us in the darkness. Take the key with you.
And hurry.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Acting upon this plan, they were soon
slipping over the small stones and pebbles
down a shallow gully and up among the rocks
and shrubs of a little cliff.
</p>
<p>Already the tremendous roar of the motorcycles
was close upon them.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Quick, Eveley, behind this bush.&mdash;Lie
down flat. Yes, all right, Angelo. Sh, quiet
now.&#8221;
</p>
<div class='figcenter'>
<img src='images/illus-327.jpg' alt='' title='' /><br />
<p class='caption' style='text-align:center;'>
&#8220;Please let me go,&#8221; she pleaded.
<br />
</p>
</div>

<div><span class='pagenum'><a id='page_329' name='page_329'></a>329</span></div>
<p>At that instant the motorcycles whirled
past&mdash;a sudden call from the familiar voice
of Amos Hiltze, and with a great tearing and
crashing of brakes, the cycles stopped and
the men ran back to the car.
</p>
<p>&#8220;It is her car,&#8221; cried Amos Hiltze. &#8220;They
have deserted it. They must be very close,
we shall find them quickly. You go&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;We can not find them,&#8221; said a new authoritative
voice. &#8220;The cops may be here any
moment. We&#8217;ve got to get away to-night,
or it is everlastingly too late. You have lost
the girl&mdash;lost them both. Now make the best
of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>And one motorcycle was started again.
</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll slash their tires for luck,&#8221; said Amos
Hiltze. &#8220;And we can send a couple of men
to look for them. Then we can send back
for them later on if they find them.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley ground her teeth at the ripping of
the tires, for the rubber is to a motorist as
a baby to a loving mother. But in a moment
came the sputter and roar of the motors, and
the men had gone again back the road they
had come.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_330' name='page_330'></a>330</span></p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to crawl into Flynn
Springs on the rims, and phone for Nolan.
It can not be far.&#8221;
</p>
<p>But even that was impossible, for with
devilish foresight, Amos Hiltze had taken the
timer from the carburetor, and the little Rolls
was powerless.
</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll walk then,&#8221; said Eveley bravely,
and hand in hand, the three of them set out
on the rocky winding road to Flynn Springs.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolan will not waste any time coming for
us,&#8221; said Eveley confidently.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And perhaps Lieutenant Ames is in town
and can come also,&#8221; suggested Marie softly.
</p>
<p>Some time later, wearily, weakly, they
limped into Flynn Springs, and Eveley hurriedly
put in her call.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolan? It is Eveley. I am at Flynn
Springs. You must come for me, and bring
Jimmy Ames. Yes, Marie is with me, and
Angelo.&mdash;Yes, we are all right. And have a
man from the garage with extra tires and a
timer for the carburetor. No, we do not need
the police. No guns either. Nolan, your voice
is sweeter than any angel&#8217;s.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_331' name='page_331'></a>331</span></p>
<p>Then they went into a small room where
there was a bed, and Eveley took off her
ruined pumps, and bathed her burning feet,
and they fixed their hair, and had hot coffee,
always looking at each other with tender
eyes.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Will you never go back on me again, little
sister?&#8221;
</p>
<p>And Marie kissed her in answer.
</p>
<p>So they waited patiently for the men
breaking all known speed laws to come to
them, and the time did not seem long, for
they lay on the bed together, each with an
arm across the other&#8217;s shoulder. And in the
small dark hallway outside, Angelo sat before
their door, his arms clasped around his
knees, his head sunk upon his breast, sound
asleep. But even in his sleep keeping guard
over his Americanizer and the &#8220;little
Greaser.&#8221;

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>HER ONE EXCEPTION</h3>
</div>

<p>All evening Kitty had been trying to get
Nolan by telephone, always being told
that he was not at the hotel and had gone to
the office, and then hearing that the office line
was busy. It was after eight when she finally
got him on the wire.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolan, whoever have you been talking to?
If it was anybody else besides Eveley, I am
going to tell. I have been trying to get you
all evening. I want you to come over here
immediately. Something terrible is about to
happen, and you must stop it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan hesitated. &#8220;I am to be at Eveley&#8217;s
at nine, but if you promise to talk fast I will
come.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Receiving her fervent assurance, he immediately
closed his desk, and in ten minutes
Kitty was drawing him feverishly into her
favorite corner of the living-room.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Nolan, you could never guess what is going
on.&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_333' name='page_333'></a>333</span></p>
<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he admitted, with a reminiscent
smile. &#8220;So many odd things have been going
on lately that I confess my inability as a
guesser.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen to this. Eveley&#8217;s sister has fallen
in love with some crazy aviator, and is going
to elope with him. And she wants Burton to
get a divorce so she can marry him.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan was plainly dumfounded at this revelation.
</p>
<p>&#8220;And that is not the worst. She is going
to desert those two children, and Eveley&mdash;You
know Eve. She says she will be the willing
sacrifice to save the honor of the family,
and has decided to marry Burton herself, to
be a mother to Winifred&#8217;s children.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Preposterous!&#8221; gasped Nolan, looking into
her flushed face for symptoms of delirium.
</p>
<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; came the grim answer. &#8220;But we
must never allow such a bloodcurdling thing
to happen. It wouldn&#8217;t be right. I want you
to go right over to Eveley&#8217;s as fast as you
can, and make her marry you. You can pretend
you do not know anything about this,
and sweep her right off her feet. Get her
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_334' name='page_334'></a>334</span>
promise before she knows what is going on,
and marry her before she realizes it. Then
perhaps Winifred will come to her senses and
not do this outrageous thing.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;But, Kitty&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You love Eveley, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, of course, but&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then do you call yourself a man, and yet
stand idly by and see the woman you love
sacrifice her life for her sister&#8217;s honor&mdash;and&mdash;er
babies&mdash;and&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;And husband,&#8221; he said gloomily. &#8220;I could
stand the honor and the babies, but I object
to the husband.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course you do. I have my car here,
and I will take you right over to Eveley&#8217;s
and you can settle it immediately.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not believe I could propose before
you, Kitty,&#8221; he objected shyly. &#8220;I could not
think of the words.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I shall wait in the car until it is over.
Then I shall come sauntering up later on and
wish you joy, etc., and Eveley need not know
I had a thing to do with it. Just you get her
promise, and I shall be witness for you. If
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_335' name='page_335'></a>335</span>
she tries to back out we shall sue her for
breach of promise.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;All right,&#8221; he decided suddenly. &#8220;We
certainly can not submit to any such nonsense
as this. Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;
</p>
<p>All the way to the Cloud Cote they kept up
hearty agreement that the idea was utterly
wild and preposterous, and that Nolan should
never stand for it. As she stopped the car,
two doors down where Eveley could not see
from her window, Kitty said:
</p>
<p>&#8220;Arnold and I want to take a honeymoon
trip to Yosemite after we are married, and
we want you and Eveley to get married in
time to go along. It is so much more fun
when everybody&#8217;s married.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, you fix it up with Eveley, and when
you are through pull back the shade in the
living-room, and I&#8217;ll take it for a sign and
come up to make my call.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So Nolan went up the rustic steps to
Eveley, and Kitty settled down in a corner
of the car. For thirty minutes she chuckled
gleefully to herself, but after half an hour she
began to feel that he was decidedly slow.
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_336' name='page_336'></a>336</span></p>
<p>&#8220;I could be engaged to a dozen people in
that time,&#8221; she thought impatiently, &#8220;Oh,
the poky thing. But I suppose they are waxing
demonstrative, and he has forgotten me.&#8221;
</p>
<p>She toyed restlessly with the keys and
screws on the car, still watching the black
window in the Cloud Cote with only the faint
gleam of light from behind.
</p>
<p>&#8220;An hour,&#8221; she cried at last furiously. &#8220;If
that isn&#8217;t the limit! I have a notion to go
right home, and let him settle it as best he
can&mdash;but I do want to see how Eveley takes
it. Oh, well, I shall give him fifteen minutes
more, and then if he has not signaled I&#8217;ll
go up and see for myself.&#8221;
</p>
<p>So she waited another uneasy quarter of an
hour, and then banged stormily out of the car
and up the rustic steps. Her sharp tap
brought a sudden scurry and scramble from
within, but Kitty did not wait for a summons.
She drew back the portières and
climbed in, uninvited.
</p>
<p>Eveley was standing flushed and brilliant
in the center of the room, trying to tuck up
badly straying curls, and Nolan was adjusting
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_337' name='page_337'></a>337</span>
himself to the davenport with an air of
studied ease.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, Kitty,&#8221; cried Eveley nervously.
&#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you phone you were coming
over?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;You do not seem any too glad to see me,&#8221;
said Kitty rather peevishly, and then at their
flushed and shining faces, she laughed. &#8220;My,
how happy you look! Just like newlyweds&mdash;or
something.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;something,&#8221; said Eveley. She
flashed a questioning look at Nolan, and received
a reassuring nod. &#8220;Nolan and I are
engaged, Kitty.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Really,&#8221; cried Kitty. &#8220;After all these
years. How surprising.&#8221; She put her arms
around Eveley lovingly. &#8220;When did all this
happen?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night, coming down from Flynn
Springs,&#8221; said Eveley. &#8220;We&mdash;we had a whole
car full of it.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night!&#8221; Kitty quickly disengaged
herself from Eveley&#8217;s arm and looked sharply
at Nolan, smiling in great contentment on
the davenport. &#8220;Last night?&#8221;
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_338' name='page_338'></a>338</span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, last night. It was an awfully big
night all around, wasn&#8217;t it, Nolan?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;It was for me,&#8221; he said, coming over and
taking Eveley&#8217;s hand in his.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Last night,&#8221; Kitty repeated again, glaring
intently at Nolan.
</p>
<p>He nodded.
</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you knew I was lying all the time.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, since Eveley and I had luncheon
with Winifred and Burton to-day to announce
our engagement,&mdash;yes, I may say that I was
fairly well assured you were lying. They
seemed on their usual tender terms at noon.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;What are you two talking about?&#8221; wondered
Eveley.
</p>
<p>Kitty drew her small hat over her ears
with a vicious tug.
</p>
<p>&#8220;But we shall be glad to motor to Yosemite
with you and Arnold this summer,&#8221; Nolan
went on pacifically, &#8220;we think it will be great
sport. We asked Marie and Jimmy Ames to
go along. They are going to be married to-morrow.
They are in Marie&#8217;s room now, so
go in and congratulate them if you like. But
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_339' name='page_339'></a>339</span>
do not bring them out here, because we are
a crowd already.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;I am going home, anyhow, if you mean
me,&#8221; she said pettishly. She looked at Eveley.
&#8220;I suppose you think it is very clever for you
to be engaged to Nolan twenty-four hours
without notifying me, after all the trouble I
have taken in the last five years to bring it
about. And as for you, Nolan, I think you
have a lot of courage to marry a woman who
openly and notoriously refuses to do her duty
in any shape, size or form. I call it a pretty
big risk, myself.&#8221; She clambered crossly
through the window. &#8220;Congratulations,&#8221; she
called back snappily. And again, from half-way
down the stairs: &#8220;And we shall hold
you to the Yosemite bargain, too.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Then Nolan took Eveley in his arms again
and kissed her. &#8220;It may be pretty risky,&#8221; he
said tenderly. &#8220;A wife who steels her heart
against her duty&mdash;&#8221;
</p>
<p>Eveley smiled into his eyes. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry.
The One Exception will save you. I still
claim that duty isn&#8217;t the biggest thing in the
<span class='pagenum'><a id='page_340' name='page_340'></a>340</span>
world. And hasn&#8217;t my theory held good? Patriotic
duty could not Americanize Angelo
nor Marie, nor anybody else. And filial duty
could not make the Severs live happily with
the Father-in-law. And domestic duty could
not bring Miriam and Lem Landis into harmony.
But there was something else big
enough to work all the miracles, and it was
the Big Exception.&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, tell me, Eveley&mdash;the Big Exception
that is Everybody&#8217;s Duty&mdash;what is it?&#8221;
</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; she said, snuggling a little closer
into his arms, &#8220;I believe it is everybody&#8217;s
duty to love somebody else with all his heart
and mind and soul and body. And that is
what has worked all the transformations for
our friends. And it will protect you, Nolan&mdash;for
I do.&#8221;
</p>
<p>Nolan kissed her again. &#8220;Then it is no
risk at all,&#8221; he whispered, laughing tenderly.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to do your duty by me&mdash;just go
on loving me like this.&#8221;

<p><span style='text-decoration:underline'>MICHAEL O&#8217;HALLORAN.</span> Illustrated by Frances Rogers.</p>

<p>Michael is a quick-witted little Irish newsboy, living in Northern
Indiana. He adopts a deserted little girl, a cripple. He also assumes
the responsibility of leading the entire rural community upward
and onward.
</p>
<p><span style='text-decoration:underline'>LADDIE.</span> Illustrated by Herman Pfeifer.</p>

<p>This is a bright, cheery tale with the scenes laid in Indiana. The
story is told by Little Sister, the youngest member of a large family,
but it is concerned not so much with childish doings as with the love
affairs of older members of the family. Chief among them is that
of Laddie and the Princess, an English girl who has come to live in
the neighborhood and about whose family there hangs a mystery.
</p>
<p><span style='text-decoration:underline'>THE HARVESTER.</span> Illustrated by W. L. Jacobs.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Harvester,&#8221; is a man of the woods and fields, and if the
book had nothing in it but the splendid figure of this man it would
be notable. But when the Girl comes to his &#8220;Medicine Woods,&#8221;
there begins a romance of the rarest idyllic quality.
</p>
<p><span style='text-decoration:underline'>FRECKLES.</span> Illustrated.</p>

<p>Freckles is a nameless waif when the tale opens, but the way in
which he takes hold of life; the nature friendships he forms in the
great Limberlost Swamp; the manner in which everyone who meets
him succumbs to the charm of his engaging personality; and his
love-story with &#8220;The Angel&#8221; are full of real sentiment.
</p>
<p><span style='text-decoration:underline'>A GIRL OF THE LIMBERLOST.</span> Illustrated.</p>

<p>The story of a girl of the Michigan woods; a buoyant, loveable
type of the self-reliant American. Her philosophy is one of love and
kindness towards all things; her hope is never dimmed. And by
the sheer beauty of her soul, and the purity of her vision, she wins from
barren and unpromising surroundings those rewards of high courage.
</p>
<p><span style='text-decoration:underline'>AT THE FOOT OF THE RAINBOW.</span> Illustrations in colors.</p>

<p>The scene of this charming love story is laid in Central Indiana.
The story is one of devoted friendship, and tender self-sacrificing
love. The novel is brimful of the most beautiful word painting of
nature, and its pathos and tender sentiment will endear it to all.
</p>
<p><span style='text-decoration:underline'>THE SONG OF THE CARDINAL.</span> Profusely illustrated.</p>

<p>A love ideal of the Cardinal bird and his mate, told with delicacy
and humor.
